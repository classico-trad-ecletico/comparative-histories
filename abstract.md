Since the mid-nineteenth century, there have been two dominant modes of
presenting, discussing, and classifying the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, made famous by Banister Fletcher's eponymous book.
Since the postwar period, however, criticism
became so central to our understanding of the "duty" of history
that we would hardly admit comparative studies as a
form *history* at all. This notwithstanding, the comparative
form has a stronger claim to being *architecture*.

The critical understanding of history is ultimately best suited to
analyzing building cultures that are themselves self-consciously
historicist, hence the drift of current architectural historiography
towards an ever greater emphasis on modernism.
This brings up a long-standing
paradox regarding the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice.

Comparative histories of architecture were developed in 19^th^-century
Europe at the intersection of the Idealist philosophy of history and the
modern discipline of architecture. Textbooks such as James Fergusson's
*Illustrated Handbook of Architecture*,
Auguste Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture*, or
Banister Fletchers' *History of Architecture on the Comparative Method*
portrayed architectural history as a sequence of
characteristic styles determined by the
constraints of the natural and social context.
Comparative history was embedded into the European theory and practice
of architecture, blending seamlessly with
professional education.

The critical historians' refutation of Idealism
since the twentieth century disputed both the evolutionism and the
disciplinary bounds of comparative history.
Critical history arose as a denunciation of operative anachronism;
criticism's emphasis on fragments not synthesis made interest in
the disciplinary textbook falter.
A major achievement of critical theorists was to dispel the belief in a
universal standard for assessing different cultures. At the same time,
architectural history must integrate the irreducible diversity of
cultures into "global" surveys for consumption in the humanistic
educational model of architecture schools in the Americas.

This paradox shows in the narrative
choices of a couple of recent, paradigm-shifting textbooks. One of them,
*A Global History of Architecture* by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark
Jarzombek, and Vikramāditya Prakāsh, evaded the
Idealist narrative by juxtaposing examples in simple chronological
order; in so doing, however, it reinforced the Idealist principle that only
linear time underpins critical meaning. Kathleen James-Chakraborty, on
the other hand, circumvented the historicist pitfall in her book
*Architecture since 1400* by mostly restricting her work to cultures
that are increasingly aware of their own history and modernization.

Even more recent works, such as the
21^st^ edition of so-called *Banister Fletcher's Global History of
Architecture* or SmartHistory's *Reframing Art History*, attempted a way
out of this conundrum by drifting away from the unified textbook and
towards the "Companion" form. The effects of this approach on
architectural history survey courses are yet to be seen.

By confronting critical histories of architecture with
the unapologetically disciplinary approach of comparative histories, we
can begin to unpack the ways in which different forms of writing have
been legitimized in different contexts as "proper" history or as
"properly architectural" history. This brings other, more practical
questions to the surface as well. For example, which
other disciplinary approaches, such as vernacular studies or the
archaeology of architecture, have also been sidelined
by non-disciplinary criticism among historians? Can a survey be
organized around some other criterion than chronological order or
culture-epochs, yet remain intelligible and honest to its subject? For
better or for worse, these questions show how much of the legacy of
comparative history still bears upon the paradoxes of critical history.

Much of the disciplinary knowledge about buildings of the past does not,
indeed, make the cut of critical history. This knowledge, however,
continues to provide source material for writing histories of
architecture that pride themselves on a critical perspective. The
contradiction between both domains may well be inescapable.
Even so, architectural history has yet to come to terms with the
legitimacy of disciplinary knowledge of the architectural past. Failure
to do so has led not only to an uneasy coexistence between history and
its supporting fields, but even to the continued creeping of Idealist
assumptions into historical narratives.
