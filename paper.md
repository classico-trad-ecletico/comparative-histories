# Introduction #

In this paper, I contrast two very different ways of looking at the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, made famous by Banister Fletcher's eponymous book
[@fletcher:1905history]. More recently, however, critique has become so
central to our understanding of the "duty" of history
[@tafuri:1968teorie] that we would hardly admit comparative studies as a
form *history* at all. Still, I argue the comparative form has a
stronger claim to being *architecture*. This brings up a long-standing
paradox regarding the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice. I discuss how this paradox plays out in a few
recent textbooks that attempted to distance themselves from the
comparative method. Then, I look at other disciplinary methods used in
the study of past architecture and their relation to historical
critique.

# Rise and fall of comparative history #

Comparative histories of architecture were developed in Europe during
the second half of the 19^th^ century at the intersection of two
intellectual movements: the Idealist philosophy of history and the
articulation of the disciplinary field of architecture. Comparative
textbooks such as Fergusson's early *Illustrated Handbook of
Architecture*, Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture*, and Fletchers'
*History of Architecture on the Comparative Method* portrayed
architectural history as a collection of culture--epochs through time
and space, each signaled by a characteristic style. These styles did not
arise at random, but resulted almost deterministically from the
interplay between the historical unfolding of the human mind and the
constraints of geography, climate, materials, and inherited technical
knowledge.

At the same time, the discourse of comparative history gave great weight
to the architects' decision-making in response to these external
constraints. Like art history, architectural scholarship in
19^th^-century Europe was concerned with making sense of a growing body
of works unveiled by archaeology and colonialism. Unlike art history, on
the other hand, the history of architecture could not retreat into a
narrative of formal autonomy. The systematic knowledge of classical and
non-classical styles developed alongside the European architects'
insecurity about the very nature of the profession.

Comparative studies were therefore called upon to provide both
justification for aesthetic judgments---that is, the choice among a
myriad styles---and a rationale for framing the discipline of
architecture as a whole. The professional expertise of the architect was
described historically in surveys of architectural decision-making
visible through canonical buildings, while at the same time being
defined by the 19^th^-century architect's knowledge and use of such
precedents [@epron:1997comprendre].

In this textbook format, history was seamlessly
embedded in the theory and professional practice of the discipline.

implied or, in the
latter case, explicitly claimed European architecture alone had the
superior ability to perform meaningful historical change out of the
passage of time.

# Critical history and its discontents #

Since the mid-20^th^ century, critical theorists and historians such as
Benjamin and Tafuri discredited the Idealist philosophy of history.

A major achievement of critical theorists was to dispel the belief in a
universal standard for assessing different cultures. At the same time,
architectural history must integrate the irreducible diversity of
cultures into 'global' surveys. This paradox shows in the narrative
choices of a couple of recent, paradigm-shifting textbooks. One of them,
*A Global History of Architecture* by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark
Jarzombek, and Vikramāditya Prakāsh, evades the Idealist narrative by
juxtaposing examples in simple chronological order; in so doing,
however, it reinforces the Western idea that only linear time underpins
critical meaning. Another one, *Architecture Since 1400* by Kathleen
James-Chakraborty, showcases different societies walled off from one
another in discrete chapters, an ethnographic structure that downplays
the increasingly global cultural and economic networks.

Even as these two books explicitly reject the colonial *argument* for
European supremacy, their approaches to 'collecting' buildings and
societies uphold the colonial *structure* of the universal ethnographic
museum, curious but exotic to its target audience---the post-Postmodern,
Western student. I contend it is these books' very partaking in the
non-disciplinary understanding of 'critical history' that has made them
fall into this Idealist pitfall. By confronting their perspectives with
the unapologetically disciplinary approach of comparative histories, we
can begin to unpack the ways in which different forms of writing have
been legitimized in different contexts as 'proper' history or as
'properly architectural' history. This brings other, more practical
questions to the surface as well. For example, which
other disciplinary approaches, such
as vernacular studies or building archaeology, have also been sidelined
by non-disciplinary criticism among historians? Can a survey be
organized around some other criterion than chronological order or
culture-epochs, yet remain intelligible and honest to its subject? For
better or for worse, these questions show how much of the legacy of
comparative history still bears upon the paradoxes of critical history.

# Critical history and the textbook #

Colonial aspect of comparative history did not come up until long after
the genre was discredited by critical history: beating a dead horse, or
is it? Actually, comparative history lived on.

<!--
   -We found your abstract particularly compelling, but believe that it
   -could benefit from more detail, for example, what are the few recent
   -books that you will be considering in your position paper. We would like
   -to encourage you to read the RT provocation and make sure your abstract
   -states a position in response. Before 20 December, please send us the
   -final version of your abstract.

   -
   -Yes, histories of architecture do produce traditions: the styles
   -associated with certain periods, the connections made between tendencies
   -and a certain group of architects. Above all, the conjectures which
   -historians have construed and constructed in the delusion that they can
   -capture the Zeitgeist. Nevertheless, should this ever-growing body of
   -work be taken for History? To what extent does a text on the past
   -approximate History? More specifically, what is the intersection between
   -History and histories of architecture? Not every work concerned with
   -past architecture is categorically historical, especially those written
   -in the last twenty years. With the contemporary demise of Theory at
   -least in architectural praxis, the decline of which was foreshadowed by
   -the death of Jacques Derrida, useful binaries such as history and
   -theory, history and criticism have lost their visibility, smoothing the
   -way for the prevailing textuality. This turn of events is coterminous
   -with the dissemination of contemporary digital networks engineered by
   -global capitalism. Rather than to claim “the death of history,” the
   -question is in what capacity does architectural history index History
   -beyond contingencies, without reducing the text to only empirical
   -realities, including those collected through archival research.
   -
   -To go beyond “reportage” and “textuality,” the two unconscious
   -dimensions of contemporary history writing, we should recall the past
   -accurately. Manfredo Tafuri, for one, said it all: there is no criticism
   -but history. We argue that there is no history but historical criticism.
   -In this sense, the non-contemporaneity implied in the dialectics of past
   -and present plays a crucial role to the point that, like a detective,
   -the historian should seek clues lost in between fragments of collected
   -facts, subjective and objective. To follow E.P. Thompson, to be
   -critically effective, the historiography of architecture should organise
   -and interpret facts and ideas taking into account the specific
   -traditions established by the mole of History. We invite papers that
   -respond to the provocations framed above and that investigate critical
   -strategies in architectural historiography with a focus on one of these
   -topics: heritage and the past present, monumentality and the past
   -frozen, landscape and the everlasting, historical time and temporality,
   -and contemporaneity of architecture and history.
