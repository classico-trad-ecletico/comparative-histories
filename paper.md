# Introduction #

In this paper, I contrast two very different ways of looking at the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, made famous by Banister Fletcher's eponymous book
[@fletcher:1905history]. More recently, however, critique has become so
central to our understanding of the "duty" of history
[@tafuri:1968teorie] that we would hardly admit comparative studies as a
form *history* at all. Still, I argue the comparative form has a
stronger claim to being *architecture*. This brings up a long-standing
paradox regarding the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice. I discuss how this paradox plays out in a few
recent textbooks that attempted to distance themselves from the
comparative method. Then, I look at other disciplinary methods used in
the study of past architecture and their relation to historical
critique.

# Rise and fall of comparative history #

Comparative histories of architecture were developed in Europe during
the second half of the 19^th^ century at the intersection of two
intellectual movements: on the one hand, the Idealist philosophy of
history, running from Vico and Winckelmann
[@momigliano:1990classical, 75] to Hegel, Herder, and Marx
[@rose:1984marxs]; on the other hand, the articulation of the
disciplinary field of architectural practice and education that Épron
saw at the heart of eclecticism [@epron:1997comprendre]. Comparative
textbooks such as Fergusson's early *Illustrated Handbook of
Architecture* [@fergusson:1855illustrated], Barberot's *Histoire des
styles* [@barberot:1891histoire], Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture*
[@choisy:1899histoire], or Fletchers' *History of Architecture on the
Comparative Method* [@fletcher:1905history] portrayed architectural
history as a collection of culture--epochs through time and space, each
signaled by a characteristic style [@barberot:1891histoire1, v]. These
styles did not arise at random, but resulted almost deterministically
from the interplay between the historical unfolding of the human mind
and the constraints of geography, climate, materials, and inherited
technical knowledge.

The deterministic development of style was not the only aspect of an
Idealist philosophy of history that these 19^th^-century textbooks
borrowed. They also consolidated a practice that would become a hallmark
of architectural history textbooks to the present day: using a few,
paradigmatic examples to stand in for the general character of a
culture--epoch [@ghirardo:2008review67]. Idealist systems of art
history, from Hegel to Wölfflin and Zevi, are infamous (and somewhat
unfairly so) for having little concern for the particulars of individual
facts. Choisy, for example, drew analyses from a wealth of specific
buildings from the Ancient and Medieval Mediterranean. He had studied
some of these in detail in his earlier work on Roman and Byzantine
architecture [@choisy:1873romains; @choisy:1883byzantins]. In his
broader *Histoire de l'architecture*, on the other hand, he presented
only partial aspects of each building insofar as they served to
illustrate the general characteristics and trends of each style. In a
sense, Choisy's canon is not made of great works, but of general
principles; the Renaissance, a period when individual character slowly
gains ground over cultural trends, is only superficially discussed at
the end of the second volume of his textbook.

Comparative histories of architecture did not, of course, invent
the Western canon and its oversimplifications. However, James Fergusson,
for one, may very well have been partly responsible for giving a
rationale for this canon. Long before Banister Fletcher's "historical"
and "non-historical" styles [@baydar:1998postcolonial, 11], in 1855
Fergusson split the history of architecture between, on the one hand,
most "Pagan" styles, and on the other hand, "Christian" buildings
together with their direct precedents in "Pagan", i.e. classical,
societies [@fergusson:1855illustrated1, vii]. Thus, he implied only that
strand leading through classical Antiquity to the Gothic style was
worthy of study for its historical development.

At the same time as it painted architecture in general strokes where the
individual building was only proof of a general concept, the discourse
of comparative history gave great weight to the architects'
decision-making in response to these external constraints. This apparent
contradiction is resolved when we look at the context in which
architectural history arose. Like art history, architectural scholarship
in 19^th^-century Europe was concerned with making sense of a growing
body of works unveiled by archaeology and colonialism. Unlike art
history, on the other hand, the history of architecture could not
retreat into a narrative of formal autonomy. The systematic knowledge of
classical and non-classical styles developed alongside the European
architects' insecurity about the very nature of the profession.
Comparative studies were therefore called upon to provide both
justification for aesthetic judgments---that is, the choice among a
myriad styles---and a rationale for framing the discipline of
architecture as a whole. The professional expertise of the architect was
described historically in surveys of architectural decision-making
visible through canonical buildings, while at the same time being
defined by the 19^th^-century architect's knowledge and use of such
precedents.

But the expertise of architects was not limited to the choice of visual
precedents: with industrial and managerial development came increasingly
specific functional requirements [@tzonis:1972non-oppressive], and these
were at the core of what differentiated the Beaux-Arts architect from
the Polytechnic engineer [@epron:1997comprendre]. It is worth noting
that Banister Fletcher himself made a career in the design of
utilitarian buildings before writing his textbook. Not only the program
strictly speaking, but a whole range of sociocultural expectations and
material, technical, or economic constraints had to be explicitly taken
into account in the design of modern plants. *Explicitly* is the key
word here, of course, since these factors had always been present in
some way or another in every building culture. The "crisis" of modern
European architecture, however, was that the myriad variables of design
were no longer taken care of by a system of traditional, impersonal
wisdom, but had to be expressly articulated with each new, unique
project [@caniggia:1987progetto, 24]. Architects thus felt the need to
emulate other "branches of artistic or scientific research" and devote
"philosophical inquiry" to their discipline
[@fergusson:1855illustrated1, v].

In this practical sense, the past was not just a moral teacher in
matters of style. It was a trove of inspirational examples where
architects had balanced a variety of social and material requirements,
responded to their cultural and geographic context, while producing
authentic styles of their own times. I contend the reason comparative
histories of architecture focused so much on visual articulation was not
because their authors were oblivious to the social or material
conditions of the production of architecture---they made explicit points
about it, and it shows in the chapter structure of Banister Fletcher's
book. Rather, it was because this kind of formal problem-solving
translated best across time and space, through very different cultures
and conditions, and therefore could be exemplary for the modern student
of architecture.

Consider, for example, the following statements drawn from each of our
sources (my italics):

> Another refinement was making all the columns slope slightly inwards,
> *so as to give an idea of strength and support to the whole.*
> [@fergusson:1855illustrated1, 269]

> The main entrance [of the English Gothic church] was frequently by a
> south-western porch, *acting as a screen against the cold winds*...
> [@fletcher:1905history, 299]

> Most romanesque barrel vaults have their intrados broken up at regular
> intervals by ribs ... *these ribs were strengthening to
> brace thin vaults. But it was chiefly during construction of these
> vaults that such ribs were useful ...* [@choisy:1899architecture2,
> 150, my translation]

In each case, the description of a motif (roman text) is followed by a
rationale for its existence, in the form of a problem this motif solved
(italicized text). This rationale was alternatively aesthetic,
functional, or structural, and each writer deployed all three kinds of
justifications at different places. Ultimately, the hierarchy of styles
in their textbooks followed not just Eurocentric prejudice, but each
writer's judgment as to the usefulness of their examples for modern
professional practice. Thus, Fergusson and Choisy included the
Mediterranean Islamic tradition within the historical development of
Western architecture, whereas Fletcher consigned it to the
"non-historical styles."

# Critical history and its discontents #

Since the mid-20^th^ century, critical theorists and historians such as
Benjamin and Tafuri discredited the Idealist philosophy of history.

A major achievement of critical theorists was to dispel the belief in a
universal standard for assessing different cultures. At the same time,
architectural history must integrate the irreducible diversity of
cultures into 'global' surveys. This paradox shows in the narrative
choices of a couple of recent, paradigm-shifting textbooks. One of them,
*A Global History of Architecture* by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark
Jarzombek, and Vikramāditya Prakāsh, evades the Idealist narrative by
juxtaposing examples in simple chronological order; in so doing,
however, it reinforces the Western idea that only linear time underpins
critical meaning. Another one, *Architecture Since 1400* by Kathleen
James-Chakraborty, showcases different societies walled off from one
another in discrete chapters, an ethnographic structure that downplays
the increasingly global cultural and economic networks.

Even as these two books explicitly reject the colonial *argument* for
European supremacy, their approaches to 'collecting' buildings and
societies uphold the colonial *structure* of the universal ethnographic
museum, curious but exotic to its target audience---the post-Postmodern,
Western student. I contend it is these books' very partaking in the
non-disciplinary understanding of 'critical history' that has made them
fall into this Idealist pitfall. By confronting their perspectives with
the unapologetically disciplinary approach of comparative histories, we
can begin to unpack the ways in which different forms of writing have
been legitimized in different contexts as 'proper' history or as
'properly architectural' history. This brings other, more practical
questions to the surface as well. For example, which
other disciplinary approaches, such
as vernacular studies or building archaeology, have also been sidelined
by non-disciplinary criticism among historians? Can a survey be
organized around some other criterion than chronological order or
culture-epochs, yet remain intelligible and honest to its subject? For
better or for worse, these questions show how much of the legacy of
comparative history still bears upon the paradoxes of critical history.

# Critical history and the textbook #

Colonial aspect of comparative history did not come up until long after
the genre was discredited by critical history: beating a dead horse, or
is it? Actually, comparative history lived on.

   -Yes, histories of architecture do produce traditions: the styles
   -associated with certain periods, the connections made between tendencies
   -and a certain group of architects. Above all, the conjectures which
   -historians have construed and constructed in the delusion that they can
   -capture the Zeitgeist. Nevertheless, should this ever-growing body of
   -work be taken for History? To what extent does a text on the past
   -approximate History? More specifically, what is the intersection between
   -History and histories of architecture? Not every work concerned with
   -past architecture is categorically historical, especially those written
   -in the last twenty years. With the contemporary demise of Theory at
   -least in architectural praxis, the decline of which was foreshadowed by
   -the death of Jacques Derrida, useful binaries such as history and
   -theory, history and criticism have lost their visibility, smoothing the
   -way for the prevailing textuality. This turn of events is coterminous
   -with the dissemination of contemporary digital networks engineered by
   -global capitalism. Rather than to claim “the death of history,” the
   -question is in what capacity does architectural history index History
   -beyond contingencies, without reducing the text to only empirical
   -realities, including those collected through archival research.
   -
   -To go beyond “reportage” and “textuality,” the two unconscious
   -dimensions of contemporary history writing, we should recall the past
   -accurately. Manfredo Tafuri, for one, said it all: there is no criticism
   -but history. We argue that there is no history but historical criticism.
   -In this sense, the non-contemporaneity implied in the dialectics of past
   -and present plays a crucial role to the point that, like a detective,
   -the historian should seek clues lost in between fragments of collected
   -facts, subjective and objective. To follow E.P. Thompson, to be
   -critically effective, the historiography of architecture should organise
   -and interpret facts and ideas taking into account the specific
   -traditions established by the mole of History. We invite papers that
   -respond to the provocations framed above and that investigate critical
   -strategies in architectural historiography with a focus on one of these
   -topics: heritage and the past present, monumentality and the past
   -frozen, landscape and the everlasting, historical time and temporality,
   -and contemporaneity of architecture and history.
