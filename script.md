# Comparative vs Critical History #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
In this paper, I contrast two ways of looking at the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, most famously Banister Fletcher's.
More recently, however, criticism has become so central to our
understanding of the "duty" of history that we
would hardly admit comparative studies as a form *history* at all.

This
notwithstanding, I argue the comparative form has a stronger claim to
being *architecture*. This brings up a long-standing paradox regarding
the place of architectural history in professional education and
practice.

I discuss how this paradox plays out in two 21^st^-century
textbooks that attempted to distance themselves from the comparative
method --- *A Global History of Architecture* and *Architecture since
1400*.

Then, I look at other disciplinary methods used in the study of
past architecture and their relation to historical criticism.

# Comparative History as Architecture #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Comparative histories of architecture were developed in 19^th^-century
Europe at the intersection of the Idealist philosophy of history and the
modern discipline of architecture.
Idealism is known for preferring the general concept to the individual
example. More importantly, however, it is
predicated on the subject's historically determined agency through the
act of construing concepts.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Textbooks such as James Fergusson's
*Illustrated Handbook of Architecture*,
Auguste Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture*, or
Banister Fletchers' *History of Architecture on the Comparative Method*
portrayed architectural history as a sequence of
characteristic styles determined by the
constraints of the natural and social context.

Comparative
histories went to great lengths to explain the agency of architects,
since it was by means of historical classifications, wrote Baydar
Gülsum, that "the boundary between the inner and outer worlds of architecture
is carefully maintained for the purposes of disciplinary regulation and
control".

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Comparative historians thus likened the unselfconscious traditions of
earlier ages to the predicament of self-conscious decision-making facing
the modern architect. They emphasized the emergence of the discipline of
architecture through the evolution of structural and
decorative devices. In this sense, then, comparative histories of
architecture were not so much *history* as they were *architecture*;
the anachronistic comparison between ancient traditions and modern
design was admitted for its usefulness as a teaching device.

# Critical History and the Global Textbook #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Materialism is the brainchild of Idealism. In practice, materialist
historiography has come to mean criticism emphasizing effective
socio-economic change, rather than conceptual worldviews.
Critical history is a development of materialism. It arose as a
denunciation of operative anachronism.

Criticism's emphasis on fragments not synthesis made interest in the
disciplinary textbook falter. Still, the humanistic ideal of
architecture education continued to demand some sort of manual, and new
textbooks continued to appear.

Spiro Kostof put forward his *Settings and Rituals* in 1981 as a
compromise between comparative history and a global perspective, but it
could not claim authoritative status for long in the ever-evolving
landscape of critical history.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Mark Jarzombek, Vikramāditya Prakāsh and Francis D. K. Ching
published *A Global History of Architecture* in 2007. Jarzombek went on
to claim a "global history" of architecture was an explicit rejection of
the "globalized" appropriation of architecture as a diverse collection
of national histories. This harked back to Sibel Bozdoğan's discussion
of the opposition between difference and diversity. Postcolonial
criticism, Bozdoğan had written, resists naturalizing cultural
differences as an ethnographic exhibition of diversity.

*A Global History of Architecture* is a disciplinary textbook geared to
the humanistic ideal prevalent in the professional education of
architects in the Americas.
Although the book's authors shunned stylistic analysis in
general, they fell into the Idealistic pitfall
that linear time is the one legitimate source of meaning for all the
world. *A Global History* reduced so-called "non-Western" societies to
the Western student's grasp of linear history.

The textbook projected backwards the contemporary anxiety about
essentializing non-Western traditions, and in so doing neutralized the
difference between the historicist societies arising in Early Modern
Eurasia and others having different understandings of cultural
transmission through time.
Upon close inspection, even the book's seemingly neutral chapter
headings appear to be aligned with conventional epochs in European art
history.

Kathleen James-Chakraborty circumvented the historicist
pitfall in her book *Architecture since 1400* by establishing the study
of cultures that are increasingly aware of their own history as the
"basic premise" of her book.

# Non-disciplinary history in architectural education #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
This insight allowed her to explore the full methodological implications
in the core "project" of critical history:
dismantling the link of architectural history to the disciplinary
delimitation of architecture in favor of a non-disciplinary history of
unbounded social processes.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
When putting forward the non-disciplinary program of critical history,
Tafuri excluded visual analysis, the disciplinary toolkit *par
excellence*. He considered it hopelessly entangled in whichever
ideological system was current. In contrast, the complex web of
relations that made up the productive system of architecture could only
be criticized in non-visual terms of relations of production.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Therefore, whereas *A Global History* packaged a critical project for
easy consumption in architectural education, *Architecture since 1400*
took the less disciplinary path of doing history *through* architecture
more than history *of* architecture. This opened up a web of possible
connections beyond the conventional boundaries of the profession.

If *A Global History* fell into the pitfall of apparent narrative
neutrality, then certainly *Architecture since 1400* fell into that of
discounting its very subject matter. For all the decentering of European

off-key:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

"Rather than merely reflecting culture, architecture
contributes to crafting it."
[-@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, p. xix]

 

Which culture? Modernization and historicism.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
But if the latter manual downplayed the disciplinary aspects of
architecture---visual composition and professional tradition---, how could
it single out an architecture that crafts culture while standing outside
it? The answer, I believe, is that behind its critical method lies a
philosophy of history: namely, modernization and historicism
as legitimation for a transcendental concept of architecture.

# Disciplinary tools in (or around) critical history #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Critical textbooks on architectural history show an incomplete
transition from the study of buildings within the disciplinary framework
of architecture, and towards a non-disciplinary historiographic ideal of
the past. This transition
will be ever incomplete because the textual craft of non-disciplinary,
critical history uses philological evidence produced by
disciplinary fields of architecture.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
This philological framework lies to a great extent, nowadays, in building
archaeology. It developed in late 19^th^-century Germany as a critical
alternative to stylistic analysis.
Nevertheless, it is still a form of disciplinary scholarship
in architecture and thus an
outlier with respect to architectural history.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The scholarship of vernacular architecture, on the other hand, has often
been viewed as operative and, therefore, un-historical.
It deals with social themes that continue into the present
and therefore
often ends up entangled with building practice, both in experimental
settings and as part of social activism.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
However, vernacular architecture studies have a
critical pedigree, that of anthropology in the 1960s and 70s.
Since then, scholars of vernacular
buildings have increasingly claimed historical status for their
research.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
A sister field of architectural
anthropology, the archaeology of architecture has an even stronger claim
for critical analysis, unrestrained by disciplinary boundaries but still
leveraging disciplinary tools drawn from architecture: the study of
functional and symbolic programs, spatial hierarchies, climate studies,
and so on.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Not a discipline, but an accusation #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The affiliation of vernacular studies to the disciplinary domain of
architecture is not without its own contradictions. Jarzombek denounced
how the operative disciplines were subsumed in the "preservation
industry" and contaminated the scholarship of global
traditional architecture with anti-global, nationalist ideologies
pertaining to an Idealistic philosophy of history. Here, Jarzombek
echoed Tafuri in holding global history is "not a discipline" but "an
accusation" tasked with exposing "the epistemological regimes... that
lie at the core of the architectural world." Still, there is no easy way
to reconcile the disciplinary toolkit of vernacular and archaeological
scholarship with the distrust critical history has for it.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Idealism creep #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Despite the ever-widening reach of criticism, then, Idealist philosophies
of history keep creeping into architectural scholarship. This may stem
from critical history deserting certain subjects or rejecting
contamination by operative requirements. In other cases, however,
Idealism shows in unstated assumptions or expedients in works that
otherwise adopt a critical method. We have thus seen
how *A Global History of Architecture* and *Architecture since 1400* had
mixed results in dismantling disciplinary narratives.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Even as these two books explicitly reject the Eurocentric *argument* for
an evolutionist history, their approaches to collecting buildings and
societies uphold the Eurocentric *structure* of a universal architecture
determined by the Idealistic framework of change through linear time.

The latest editions of Banister Fletcher's textbook, in contrast, have
attempted to break free from this structure by shunning the narrative
unity provided by coherent authorship in favor of isolated chapters
written by specialists.

This is unusual in the textbook genre and found
more often in *Companions*, although the
SmartHistory project *Reframing Art History* is another, promising
example of this approach.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Conclusion #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
However, critical history of architecture today functions
in a broad landscape where it interacts with other, more or less
disciplinary fields. The points of contact between these disciplines
and history expose conflicts between the philological toolkit drawn from
the professional field of architecture and history's critical project of
steering away from disciplinary boundaries and unitary narratives.

Much of the disciplinary knowledge about buildings of the past does not,
indeed, make the cut of critical history. This knowledge, however,
continues to provide source material for writing histories of
architecture that pride themselves on a critical perspective. The
contradiction between both domains may well be inescapable.

Even so, architectural history has yet to come to terms with the
legitimacy of disciplinary knowledge of the architectural past. Failure
to do so has led not only to an uneasy coexistence between history and
its supporting fields, but even to the continued creeping of Idealist
assumptions into historical narratives.
