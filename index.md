The genre of comparative history of architecture flourished from the mid
nineteenth to the mid twentieth centuries in Europe and the Americas.
This genre consisted of broad sketches in the 'development of styles',
understood as consequences of geographic and social conditions. It
stemmed from the Idealist philosophy of history as a meaningful social
process developing in a definite direction through time. Canonical works
such as James Fergusson's, Auguste Choisy's, and above all Banister
Fletcher's purported to show European architecture alone had the
superior ability to perform meaningful 'historical change' out of the
passage of time.

The critical historians' refutation of Idealism since the latter half of
the twentieth century chipped away at the colonialist assumption of a
deterministic flow of history, the epitome of which was European
civilization. Nevertheless, critical writers such as Lefebvre and Tafuri
remained committed to the philosophical idea that the passage of time
was the single, transcendental source of meaning in historical
criticism.

This idea opens up a blind spot in critical history in two ways. First,
the historical status of certain forms of criticism, such as vernacular
studies and building archaeology, is seldom acknowledged or these fields

A post-colonial awareness of this problematic stance has caused a number
of newer textbooks to present their material as a collection of case
studies isolated from one another. The abstract intent of a 'global'
architectural history is therefore held in check by its very
foundational assumption: that different cultures can only be assessed on
each one's own terms and therefore cannot be reduced to the transcendent
meaning Western historiography ascribes to the linear passage of time.
