Comparative histories of architecture arose in the second half of the
nineteenth century from the Idealist philosophy of history, painting the
picture of a linear evolution through culture-epochs from 'primitive' to
'modern' (European) architecture. In textbook form, this claim moved
seamlessly from historical scholarship to professional education. Since
the twentieth century, critical historians have disputed both Idealism's
evolutionary view and the disciplinary bounds of comparative history.
Nevertheless, critical historiography still stands on the shoulders of
Idealism's concept that linear time is the first condition for
historical understanding. This basic assumption became problematic once
critical theory acknowledged different cultural world-views are
irreducible to such universal principles.

This paradox of Idealist time in critical history is most evident in a
few recent textbooks. Some evade the evolutionist narrative by chaining
examples in simple chronological order. In so doing, however, they buy
into the Idealist paradigm that only linear time underpins historical
meaning---an idea foreign to many traditional cultures. Others exhibit
different culture-epochs as if they were isolated from one another,
which reads like a colonial ethnographic museum. Meanwhile, fields such
as vernacular architecture studies and building archaeology have
employed comparative strategies to useful effect.

Given the persistence of these pitfalls, architectural
history stands to gain from confronting and questioning more explicitly
the methods of comparative history and their emphasis on disciplinary
subject matter---buildings. Is change through time always the most
relevant criterion for assessing architecture?
Which strongly disciplinary approaches, such as vernacular studies or
building archaeology, have been sidelined by 'non-disciplinary'
criticism among historians? Can a survey be organized around some other
criterion than chronological order or culture-epochs, yet remain
intelligible and honest to its subject? For better or for worse, these
questions show how much of the legacy of comparative history still bears
upon the task of critical history.
