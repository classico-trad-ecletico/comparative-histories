Comparative histories of architecture arose in the second half of the
nineteenth century from the Idealist philosophy of history. Canonical
textbooks claimed European architecture alone had the superior ability
to perform meaningful 'historical change' out of the passage of time. At
the same time, comparative history was embedded into the theory and
practice of architecture, blending seamlessly with professional
education. The critical historians' refutation of Idealism since the
twentieth century disputed both the evolutionism and the disciplinary
bounds of comparative history.

A major achievement of critical theorists was to dispel the belief in a
universal standard for assessing different cultures. At the same time,
architectural history must integrate the irreducible diversity of
cultures into 'global' surveys. This paradox shows in the shortcomings
of a couple of otherwise brilliant recent textbooks. One of them evades
the Idealist narrative by juxtaposing examples in simple chronological
order; in so doing, however, it reinforces the Western idea that only
linear time underpins historical meaning---an idea utterly foreign to
many cultures it portrays, and quite confusing in practice. Another one
showcases different cultures walled off from one another in discrete
chapters; it feels like the written form of a colonial ethnographic
museum.

Given the persistence of these same old Idealist pitfalls, architectural
history stands to gain from reassessing and questioning more explicitly
the methods of comparative history and their emphasis on disciplinary
subject matter---buildings. Which strongly disciplinary approaches, such
as vernacular studies or building archaeology, have also been sidelined
by 'non-disciplinary' criticism among historians? Can a survey be
organized around some other criterion than chronological order or
culture-epochs, yet remain intelligible and honest to its subject? For
better or for worse, these questions show how much of the legacy of
comparative history still bears upon the paradoxes of critical history.

   -states a position in response. Before 20 December, please send us the

   -… experience of the mole of History burrowing through a lengthy past and
   -creating its specific traditions in the process.                    
   -E. P. Thompson

   -Yes, histories of architecture do produce traditions: the styles
   -associated with certain periods, the connections made between tendencies
   -and a certain group of architects. Above all, the conjectures which
   -historians have construed and constructed in the delusion that they can
   -capture the Zeitgeist. Nevertheless, should this ever-growing body of
   -work be taken for History? To what extent does a text on the past
   -approximate History? More specifically, what is the intersection between
   -History and histories of architecture? Not every work concerned with
   -past architecture is categorically historical, especially those written
   -in the last twenty years. With the contemporary demise of Theory at
   -least in architectural praxis, the decline of which was foreshadowed by
   -the death of Jacques Derrida, useful binaries such as history and
   -theory, history and criticism have lost their visibility, smoothing the
   -way for the prevailing textuality. This turn of events is coterminous
   -with the dissemination of contemporary digital networks engineered by
   -global capitalism. Rather than to claim “the death of history,” the
   -question is in what capacity does architectural history index History
   -beyond contingencies, without reducing the text to only empirical
   -realities, including those collected through archival research.
   -
   -To go beyond “reportage” and “textuality,” the two unconscious
   -dimensions of contemporary history writing, we should recall the past
   -accurately. Manfredo Tafuri, for one, said it all: there is no criticism
   -but history. We argue that there is no history but historical criticism.
   -In this sense, the non-contemporaneity implied in the dialectics of past
   -and present plays a crucial role to the point that, like a detective,
   -the historian should seek clues lost in between fragments of collected
   -facts, subjective and objective. To follow E.P. Thompson, to be
   -critically effective, the historiography of architecture should organise
   -and interpret facts and ideas taking into account the specific
   -traditions established by the mole of History. We invite papers that
   -respond to the provocations framed above and that investigate critical
   -strategies in architectural historiography with a focus on one of these
   -topics: heritage and the past present, monumentality and the past
   -frozen, landscape and the everlasting, historical time and temporality,
   -and contemporaneity of architecture and history.
