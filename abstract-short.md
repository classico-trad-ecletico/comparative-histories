  This chapter contrasts comparative histories of architecture, prevalent
  from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries, to the critical method of
  history that is claimed by recent works. Comparative history arose out
  of the Idealist philosophy of history and combined its deterministic
  narrative with a disciplinary bounding of architecture that followed
  modern assumptions about decision-making in design. Critical history,
  on the other hand, is a materialistic approach that does not
  acknowledge disciplinary boundaries. Whereas critical history may lay
  claim, nowadays, to being the only proper form of historiography,
  comparative histories were more closely linked to the methods and
  categorizations of the discipline of architecture. Some recent
  architectural history textbooks, committed as they were to the
  critical method, nevertheless allowed Idealistic determinism to creep
  into their narrative structure. I argue this creep is not a
  shortcoming of these individual works, but a consequence of the
  contradictions between the non-disciplinary project of critical
  history and its uncertain place in the professional architectural
  education. I further develop on this contradiction by comparing it
  to the broader problem of how the critical history of architecture
  relates to supporting disciplines such as building archaeology, the
  archaeology of architecture, or the scholarship of vernacular
  environments. These fields interact with history by providing source
  material and preliminary interpretations, yet they have an uneasy
  relationship to critical history due to their partial reliance on
  concepts and categories developed in the professional practice of
  architecture. The inability of critical architectural history to come
  to terms with the historical legitimacy of its supporting disciplines
  is akin to its inability to acknowledge the persistence of Idealistic
  assumptions in textbooks that cater to the professional education
  market.
