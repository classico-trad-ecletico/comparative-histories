Despite not leaving any built work, Leroy is a major international figure of eighteenth-century architectural theory and culture. Considering the place that Leroy occupied in various intellectual circles of the Enlightenment and Revolutionary period, this book examines the sources for his ideas about architectural history and theory and defines his impact on subsequent architectural thought. This book will be of key interest to graduate students and scholars of Enlightenment-era architectural history.},

  abstract = {From the seventeenth century onwards, the systematic discovery of the lands to the east of Europe gradually established the Orient as the subject matter of representation--of illustrated travel accounts, etchings, engravings, paintings and sketches. This needs to be seen as part of a larger historical episode which has installed representation as the principal construct of knowledge in Western culture. The Orient is thereby objectified into a form of discourse, as Edward Said has brilliantly shown us, as well as into a stereotypical image for consumption and a stylistic category in architecture. Through a critique of Orientalist constructs, this paper intends to draw attention to an alternative way of looking at the Orient: one that does not turn it into an independent, frozen reality outside the self-knowing subject, but instead, enters into its world, engages with it and employs representation as a critical/exploratory vehicle rather than an affirmative/expository one. It is in this sense that the experiential sketches and scribbles of Le Corbusier in his "Journey to the East" offer us some insight the implications of which are highly significant and relevant for the current architectural culture at large.},

First, how does one make architectural history less Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of architecture without reducing architecture to politics?},

  abstract = {In an effort to expand on the traditional rationalist interpretation of Viollet-le-Duc, this article explores his ideas of progress and history. Viollet's "reason" is described as a dialectical structure which develops in time, unfolding through history. From his description of the origins of architecture to his account of the great periods of mankind, Viollet's philosophy of history presents an ideology of freedom; and through it he attempts to demonstrate humanity's progressive transformation of a nature originally hostile to man into a new world in harmony with him. The historical dialectic follows three distinct stages: Asian civilization (theocraty), Antiquity (aristocraty) and finally Christianity (democraty), which is a synthesis of the previous two. Such trinitarian rule is basic to the dialectical process itself. It underlies not only Viollet's philosophy of history but also his philosophy of nature (theory of crystals). Technique is the realm of human activity which, for Viollet, best speaks of man's dialectical engagement with the world. Viollet's central notion of style defines a technical activity; an object endowed with style must result from the struggle between the real (the world of nature and tradition, the given facts from which human action starts out) and the ideal (the world of human aspirations and progress). Style is an expression of dialectical synthesis. It is in his description of the difference between Greek and Gothic architecture that Viollet's historical dialectic comes through most clearly. Greek architecture, for Viollet, is the first instance of an architecture which seeks to free itself from the enslavement to tradition. The static nature of Greek structural principles, however, still reflects a fatalistic vision of the world. In contrast, Gothic architecture is the birth of a radical spirit of invention which seeks to subjugate totally both nature and tradition. The principle of equilibrium basic to its structural organization is an example of man's cunning play with the forces of nature. It embodies the "Christian rule" which leaves to man his free will and the responsibility for his own works. Christianity is the last stage in the historical dialectic where man becomes "a creature in the image of the Creator."},

  abstract = {Architectural history books play a significant role in conveying the culture, norms, and values of the architectural discipline to newcomers. In recent years, numerous publications have spotlighted the importance of women and African Americans as critics, creators, and consumers of the built environment. Yet, to what extent is this recent discourse on gender and racial issues included in architectural history texts? And how gender or racially inclusive are they? Are twenty-first-century architectural educators presenting newly uncovered architectural histories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? Building upon prior research, this article seeks to address these issues by examining history texts currently assigned at fourteen leading architectural schools accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. In textbooks with multiple editions, we compared relevant information in both earlier and later versions. Our analysis of these history texts revealed that contributions of women remain only marginally represented in the grand narrative of architecture. And for the most part, African Americans are omitted altogether. We challenge authors to reassess the next generation of architectural history texts and suggest ways to do so.},

  abstract = {The Belgian architectural world of the 19th century has been considered a fascinating though little studied crossroads of influences. The same could be said of the architectural historiography of Belgium, which only established its independence from its powerful neighbours in 1830. Two of its canonical architectural historical publications, the Histoire de l’architecture en Belgique by A.G.B. Schayes (1808–59) and the Histoire de l’influence italienne sur l’architecture dans les Pays-Bas by Auguste Schoy (1838–85), represent two different ways of dealing with textual and visual material. This emerges from a precise analysis of context, authorial voice, use of sources and illustration media and relation to repertories of images such as private print collections. Typical of Schayes’s voice are the sparsely expressed personal appreciations and the many references to archives, literature and in situ observations, as if to prove every statement in word or image. Meanwhile, he rarely refers to his authoritative position as ‘national archéologue’ (as curator of the first national collection of antiquités), nor to his collection of prints and engravings. Schoy, on the contrary, does not shy from emitting personal opinions and boasting about his precious collection, his broad knowledge of rare manuscripts and collections and his in situ explorations of buildings. The fact that Schoy’s text did not make it into the accepted references in twentieth-century architectural histories in Belgium, whereas Schayes’s did, reveals much about how the discipline was formed and which methodological selections were made during its formative period.},

Post-Renaissance theory-making fell into a pattern I call historiographic critique, which centered around the humanist imperative to link historical knowledge, social criticism, and architectural practice. In the 19th century, historiographic critique became increasingly incapable of creating viable conceptions of the past and was replaced by interdisciplinary historiography. The advantages and disadvantages of interdisciplinary historiography can already be seen in the work of Mies van der Rohe. He abolished narrow historicism in favor of consciously created dependencies between philosophy, history, and architectural theory drawn out over various times, cultures, languages, and academic disciplines. Unfortunately, the paradoxes inherent in the discursive logic of interdisciplinary historiography left it open to manipulations by intellectual formalists, in whose hands theory came to be treated as a discourse separate from its own historicity},

What was first a largely autodidactic interest in Heidegger, Bachelard, and Joyce, is now the topic of textbooks, anthologies, seminar papers, with the committed student having to be familiar with the likes of Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Barthes, Jameson, Gramsci, Derrida, Lacan, and now Deleuze. Though the architectural "take" on these philosophers is often inconsistent and spurious, the enterprise as a whole has to be understood within a system that is now almost a century old. Whether it was Le Corbusier's readings of Friedrich Nietzsche or Eric Mendelsohn's of Martin Buber, architects often turned to other disciplines, including psychology, Gestalt psychology in particular, to help position themselves within the intellectual determinants of modernity. The "history of theory" is thus more than just a specialized problem of the avant-garde. It is equivalent with the history of modernity. And yet, despite the importance of these exchanges (and despite theory's increasing self-academizations), it is still difficult for us to easily assess and historicize them.},

  abstract = {The essay is an analysis Tafuri's theory on historiography;. it traces his methodological sources: the theories, and their mode of reception, that have directly influenced his thought. The period examined starts with Theories and History of Architecture, first published in 1968 and ends with "The Historical 'Project"', the introductory essay of The Sphere and the Labyrinth, published in 1980 The first chapter outlines the intertwining of the two neo-idealist and Marxist components of Tafuri's thought, combined with the early familiarity with the writings of the Nouvelle Critique. Subsequently, it identifies the points that, in Theories and History, represent Tafuri's original contribution to architectural history: the identification of architecture as ideology and the consequent demystifying role that the historian must play; consequently, the formulation of the specific notions that will serve as the instruments for this task of the historian; the identity of history and criticism; the complete separation of the design process from the 'reading' process (Le. history writing) of a building; the logical consequence of this: the 'futility' of history and theory in design; and, finally, the obsoleteness of the mode of criticism termed "operative criticism". The second chapter tackles the problem posed by the contradictory coexistence, in Tafuri's later writings, of Marxist and neo-avant-garde positions. It analyzes in detail what neo-avant-garde ideas were, what they implied and what theoretical and methodological purposes they served. The analysis centers on the strong impact of Foucault's theories on Tafuri, and his equally strong criticism of them. Most importantly, however, it outlines the profound impact of Walter Benjamin's notion of history, particularly as exposed in "The Theses on the Philosophy of History", on Tafuri. In the last chapter, are drawn some partial conclusions on the epistemological implications of Tafuri's theory.},

  abstract = {In eighteenth-century France, the influential architect and historian Julien-David Leroy studied ancient monuments through two different methods-what he called the "historical" and the "architectural." These two approaches had distinctly different intended audiences, methods, and goals. His historical method was a traditional humanistic approach to the ancient monuments that studied a building's architecture in relation to its specific historic context. His architectural method, consistent with scientific practice, considered the relations among numerous similar monuments as a means of revealing underlying universal laws. In the eighteenth century, history and science both promised enlightenment, but the exact shape of that new knowledge and its implications for the present varied tremendously. Through a comparative analysis of his two methods, and of their development, interaction, and significance, this paper assesses the exact shape of Leroy's dualistic thought, and its implications for architectural practice, history and theory.},

Meggers, Evans, and Estrada are the most recent advocates, and their hypothesis of a landfall by Japanese fishermen on the coast of Ecuador seems to have been the causa belli of the attack by John Rowe on "doctrinaire diffusionism." In a response to Rowe, Jett and Carter (1966) suggest his level of absolute proof is the best, but not the only, proof. Rowe's absolute proof is best because it can be rigorously and objectively tested. But if this level of proof is not met, then the acceptance of such evidence becomes an "act of faith." The hypotheses of transoceanic contacts can not be evaluated adequately for or against until this level of proof is achieved. Until such time, the acceptance of such theories will remain "acts of faith."},

Our apparently anti-historicist heritage, and the perceived failure of its utopia, has cast in doubt our relationship with the past and our ability to produce a meaningful present and future. In the realms of criticism and design, there seems to be an artificial distinction between "then" and "now," leaving us in a distended present. Our concern is the meeting point of history and design in the activities of operative criticism. Operative criticism, described by Manfredo Tafuri in Theories and History of Architecture, assumes a subjective reading of history, distorting the past to re-make it for the present. Operative criticism accepts the inevitable fact that the present always conditions the perceptions of the past.},

  abstract = {It is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact of Edward Said's Orientalism on the various fields of the humanities in Western academia.1 Said's wide-ranging, profound, and multidisciplinary critique of the ways in which the triumphant culture of our times, the Western one from the Enlightenment to the present, has encountered, codified, and represented the culture of its most immediate other, the Islamic Orient, opened the door for all repressed cultures to question their received representation and to deconstruct the discourse that produced it over time.2 This has led to the revolution in the humanities that we identify today as postcolonial criticism, a revolution that was a long time coming, but Orientalism, and the charismatic personality of its author, provided the catalyst around which its diverse strands finally coalesced.3Even today, forty years after the book's publication, and despite sustained denunciation from detractors on the right and left alike, Said's fundamental critique of the political and ideological frames of knowledge in general, and knowledge about Islam in particular, still reverberates across academia worldwide. Entire domains of inquiry into the cultural production of both the colonizing and colonized worlds, as well as all marginalized minority groups and their sometimes amiable but mostly confrontational interaction, have found their ways into curricula and university programs in the West and in the postcolonial world.4 They have all benefited from the trail blazed by Said's Orientalism and his subsequent elaborations on the intersection between empire (as both locus of power and representation) and culture and the role of intellectuals in our extremely divided yet thoroughly interconnected world.5 In fact, as Anne Wagner, the prominent historian of nineteenth-century art, told me thirty years ago, scholars in the humanities cannot avoid the “post-Saidian” epistemological milieu in which they have to labor regardless of their specific fields of study or their views of Said's criticism.Architectural history—and architectural practice to a lesser extent—has felt the impact of Said's Orientalism as well, even though Said himself, a relentless literary and political critic who was also an accomplished pianist and a classical music and opera reviewer, had very little to say about architecture. Occasionally, he would mention a particular building in passing as a backdrop to his narrative in one of the essays or journalistic reviews that he regularly published in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly newspaper. But he otherwise never turned his sharp eyes and scathing wit directly to architecture, even though he was aware and appreciative of art and architectural criticism. He did, however, engage in extended debates over theoretical and historiographical issues that pertained to art and architecture, as I witnessed in 1985 when a group of graduate students of which I was a part organized a conference at MIT on the postmodern condition and invited Said and Fredric Jameson, along with several leading art and architectural theorists and critics, for two days of exhilarating intellectual one-upmanship.Unsurprisingly, the clearest influence that Said's Orientalism has had within architectural history is on the so-called non-Western subfields (a category that reeks of imperialist superiority), especially the study of Islamic architecture and modern architecture outside the West.6 But it has also affected the study of global architecture, a label and an approach that owe much to the rigorous criticism and expansive perspective that Said and other like-minded historians and critics enabled.7 Before Said, architectural history subscribed too uncritically to the canonical view of architecture as a culturally stratified domain, with the architecture of the West, from its presumed classical origins to its glorious culmination in modern times, constituting the historical core of the field, while other architectural traditions, if acknowledged at all, were relegated to marginal places in its ordered hierarchy.8 This was best exemplified by the famous “Tree of Architecture” of the two Banister Fletchers (father and son), which appeared as frontispiece in all seventeen editions of their influential book A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method for the Student, Craftsman, and Amateur, published between 1896 and 1954. This unabashed yet fanciful Eurocentric diagram reserved the living trunk and the upper, healthy branches of the tree to an uninterrupted succession of Western styles from ancient Greece to modern America (dubbed historical styles) and demoted the architecture of all other cultures (labeled nonhistorical styles) to dead-end branches functioning primarily as stylistic curiosities.9Things slowly began to change in 1985 with the publication of Spiro Kostof's A History of Architecture, one of the earliest works to respond to Said's criticism, albeit indirectly and without ever mentioning Orientalism.10 The influence, moreover, is apparent in the structure of the book rather than in its narrative or arguments, which remained wedded to the center/periphery model of analysis. Kostof not only included periods and examples of non-Western architectural traditions, a practice going back to James Fergusson and Banister Fletcher, but also, for the first time in an English-language architectural survey, presented a select few of these in comparative pairings with their chronological equivalents in the Western historical sequence. He did this exclusively between the two sides of the Mediterranean: the Christian and the Islamic, with Cairo and Florence paired together in the late Middle Ages and Istanbul and Venice in the Renaissance.11 But as architectural historian Panayiota Pyla has noted, Kostof's pairings were neither historically nor culturally symmetrical. In both examples, he could not shed his reliance on Western architecture as the “yardstick” against which the architecture of the Islamic other is measured, nor could he contextualize the Islamic examples in their own settings (his favorite phenomenological term) as he so impeccably did for the Western ones.12The centrality of Western architecture in Kostof's understanding of architectural history was even more pronounced in his short sections on those architectural traditions—such as those of India, China, and Nepal—that did not interact with the West before the colonial period. There, his review differed little from his predecessors’ except in the important distinction of his using a phenomenological language that overtly romanticized and somewhat dehistoricized architecture, as opposed to the formalist and stylistic language of his precursors, which was used to enforce a hierarchical structure of architectural traditions.13 Thus, it is possible that Kostof's atypical treatment of Islamic architecture as the privileged counterpart to premodern Western architecture was not the result of a conscious critical rethinking of architectural history's biased formation. It may in fact have been related to his familiarity with the Ottoman tradition owing to his having been raised in Istanbul. But it also could have been a subconscious reaction to Said's pointed criticism of the West's long-held derogatory attitudes toward anything Islamic, of which Kostof must have been aware and which had been intensifying in the time in which he and Said were writing—as they are again today.The methodological corrective in surveying global architecture guardedly explored by Kostof went through several stages of inconclusive refinement in the subsequent three decades, with new editions and revisions of the standard surveys in the field as well as new surveys of what began to be named “world architecture.” Thus, for instance, Fletcher's seventeenth edition of 1961 had replaced the binary division of historical and nonhistorical styles of earlier editions with another dyad that, although less overtly offensive, still endowed only Western architecture with historical evolution (“Ancient Architecture and Western Succession”) while gathering all non-Western traditions under the über-geographical and loaded label “East,” regardless of their actual location on the world map vis-à-vis Europe.14 The nineteenth edition of 1987 (notice the date), however, finally softened the hard-edged dual opposition by breaking the content into seven sections, arranged chronologically, mixing geographic pairing (Europe and the Mediterranean to the Renaissance, Islam, and early Russia) with chronological periodization (colonial and postcolonial periods outside Europe, twentieth century) in a clear attempt to transcend the exclusionary Western succession of earlier editions and to historicize other hitherto neglected traditions.15The twentieth, or centennial, edition of 1996, edited by the noted architectural historian and commentator Dan Cruickshank, with almost twenty consultant editors and contributors, further revamped the structure and tone of the book in ways that hinted at a direct reaction to the kind of criticism initiated by Said's Orientalism, although that book remained unacknowledged in the bibliography.16 This was most evident in a new section of six chapters covering the architecture of Islam from its pre-Islamic roots in Hellenistic and Persian architecture through the Gunpowder Empires of the Mughals, Safavids, and Ottomans. The last chapter in this section, however, strangely reverted to two idiomatic conceptions about Islamic architecture: the one resurrecting the quality of timelessness, focusing on vernacular architecture; the other imbued with fantasy and otherworldliness as it projects Islamic garden traditions through the prism of a paradisiacal vision that is supposed to have animated all garden design over fourteen centuries in diverse ecologies from the desert to the rain forest.17 These two tropes had long been espoused by many Orientalist historians as essential components of the canned definition of Islamic architecture as both artisanally oriented and spiritually motivated.18 The reiteration of these notions in this section ignored the many recent critical works on both subjects that challenged their validity or representativeness and questioned the motivations of those who insisted on using them. It also unveiled the residual stratum in some of the new writing in this authoritative book, one unable to disentangle itself from the Eurocentric roots of its dichotomous structure and its concomitant differential projections of historical versus changeless styles.A break from the historical, even chronological, Eurocentrism of the survey mode was needed if the field was to become truly global. This kind of approach was finally undertaken by Francis Ching, Mark Jarzombek, and Vikramaditya Prakash in their A Global History of Architecture (first edition 2006 and now in its third edition).19 As the insertion of the refurbished term global in the title implies, the book tries to transcend the Western bias of earlier world architectural surveys by using an inclusive global perspective. This is buttressed by a neutral chronological periodization and a vast time span to tell the history of world architecture from as far back as archaeological records allow. The authors clearly seek to avoid the shortcomings of their predecessors, devising a new approach that treats all architectural traditions equally by framing them in a comparative chronological structure that depends solely on numerical time frames. And notwithstanding the huge imbalance inherent in the quality and quantity of architectural data available for the various cultures and time frames covered, the authors try hard to treat all places and periods with the same level of analysis without constantly referring to a model or a core index in the form of Western architectural succession.20Here too, however, we can surmise the influence of Said's critique, which may have been due more to the authors’ general agreement with the postcolonial understanding of historiography than to their conscious reading of his books. They do not mention Said or his work, or even the term Orientalism, at all in their text, but their dismissal of the usual European cultural frame of reference and their total dependence on a chronological one betray a tacit recognition of the inevitable pitfalls of any culturally self-centered perspective in the study of other cultures. Posthumously, Said's criticism of Eurocentric nonchalance has been vindicated, even if only tacitly and without direct reference. Leveling the playing field in assessing the architectural achievements of all historical cultures, however, seems to have been the authors’ goal for A Global History of Architecture, a goal that has been reinforced by Jarzombek's pursuit of the deepest, and implicitly most common, roots of human acts of building in his Architecture of First Societies: A Global Perspective (2013), the sequel to his jointly authored global history book.21If Said's influence is at best hidden or implied in global architectural surveys published after the intellectual splash that Orientalism caused, it is more explicit, sometimes begrudgingly so, in recent studies of Islamic architecture.22 Translated into the major Islamic languages shortly after its initial publication in English, Said's book quickly became a best seller of sorts, providing students of Islamic cultural production with the critical lever they had long needed in their painful, and often unsuccessful, efforts to be admitted into their specific humanities fields as full participants rather than as area studies specialists. Historians of Islamic architecture faced the same challenge.23 Their own domain had been seen at best as a self-contained area of study that was religiously and culturally essentialist or environmentally deterministic, and at worst as derivative, passé, ornamentalist, ahistorical, and lacking in tectonic rationality.24 These dismissive notions reflected the enduring influence of two manifestly interdependent scholarly traditions: authoritative Eurocentric art and architectural historiography on one hand, and on the other, the study of Islam in the West that we came to call “Orientalism,” with its various peregrinations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Such negative views were not applied only to Islamic art and architecture. Until at least the 1970s, the same kind of disdainful attitudes framed the scope and methods of the study of all non-Western artistic and architectural subdisciplines and assigned them their prescribed slots in the chronologically, geographically, and ideologically historical and artistic Eurocentric hierarchy.25Said insisted on the discursive heritage of representation of all things Islamic, a heritage that was enthralled with and in the service of imperialism during the colonial period, which ranged variably between the sixteenth and the twentieth centuries. Indeed, the first students of Islamic architecture were all Europeans who, from as early as the 1820s, traveled to the “Orient” in the wake of the first European military interventions in search of adventure, employment, and the thrill of fantasy associated with those mysterious lands. Like other Orientalists in various fields of inquiry, they became engaged in a vast enterprise of collecting, processing, and interpreting bits of information on all aspects of history, culture, and society in the “Orient.” They visited “Oriental” cities and sites—primarily in Spain, western Turkey, the Holy Land, Egypt, and India—where they measured and recorded buildings and ruins and illustrated them. They then produced impressive catalogues of singular monuments, series of buildings, and architectural and ornamental details that introduced to Europe a rich Islamic architectural heritage that was previously almost totally unknown.26These trailblazers were followed by several generations of architects, draftsmen, and archaeologists who expanded the scope of this surveying and classification in time and space. The architects and draftsmen went after the little-known monuments in hitherto unexplored regions that were slowly opening up to Western influence and dominance. They covered Anatolia, Persia, India, Morocco, and Arabia, and eventually penetrated the faraway reaches of the Islamic world in places such as Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.27 By the middle of the twentieth century, the terrain had been mostly mapped out. With the nagging exception of Southeast Asia, most major buildings in the Islamic world had been measured, recorded, and classified into types and styles following a rather rigid dynastic periodization that is still more or less with us today.Despite their erudite and prodigious output, these Western students of Islamic architecture were neither equipped to convey nor interested in communicating the substantial intracultural variety and purposeful continuity within Islamic architecture or its conscious intercultural interactions, past and present.28 Instead, they set the stage for a self-contained architectural discourse, charting the history of Islamic architecture as an endogenous and seemingly insular tradition that began with the building of the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina around 620 CE and inexplicably fizzled out with the dawn of the colonial age.29 Their end dates varied between the Taj Mahal in Agra, India (1632–48) and the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque) in Istanbul (1609–16) (Figures 1 and 2). But these historians never crossed into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. That is, their history avoided confronting the problem of Islamic architecture's encounter with modernity and its theoretical and historiographic implications.The practice of disciplinary cultural demarcation, which depended more on ideological postures than on historical facts or scholarly reflections, survived far longer than did its biased and compromised source, the bluntly Eurocentric civilizational stratification of the triumphant colonial age.30 It promoted, and even demanded, comprehensive studies of architecture confined within clearly proscribed and exclusive time, space, and culture. It even affected the writing of many postindependence architectural historians in the sometimes incongruously formed nations of the colonized world. In their zeal to purge their emerging national identities from any potentially damning colonial or foreign influence, these scholars adopted the culturally separate line of development that the model promulgated, so as to reconstruct a “pure” and “authentic” cultural and architectural heritage.31 As succinctly noted by Frantz Fanon many years ago, and rearticulated by Edward Said in Orientalism and his later Culture and Imperialism (1993), the nationalists’ heartfelt resistance to a hegemonic intellectual construct did not prevent them from falling into the trap of its conceptual and interpretive biases. They ended up constructing and categorizing the history of “their” architecture, and of “their” culture in general, from an exclusive and ultimately narrowly defined national, religious, or cultural perspective.32 The examples of this inclination are numerous, but the most glaring and unmistakably affected histories can be seen in the various surveys of Central Asian architecture written during the Soviet period, which emphasized ethnic particularity over cultural identity, and in the studies of Iranian and Turkish architecture produced until very recently in Iran and Turkey, which sought in the distant past cultural roots that defined each nation independent of its extensive Islamic identity.33The study of Islamic architecture underwent a certain renaissance in the past few decades, owing in no small measure to the “Said effect.” This coincided with and provided intellectual prestige and rhetorical ammunition to two instrumental and ultimately interrelated phenomena, one architectural and the other, unsurprisingly, financial. The first was the onset of the age of postmodernism in architecture in the 1970s and 1980s, with its renewed if lighthearted approach to history as inspiration and its not-so-masked stress on identity politics as a formally expressive architectural tool.34 Both orientations resonated with the mounting pressure in the Islamic world for culturally and historically inspired architecture, a direction that started to express itself around the same time and for reasons that stemmed primarily from disappointment with the often half-baked, top-down, and ultimately miscarried modernist experiments conducted throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the newly independent countries.35 Thus, the 1980s became the decade of readily identifiable, Islamicized postmodern architecture that fulfilled a real hunger for cultural (and religious, which would eventually supplant the cultural with the rise of Islamism) self-expression.36 There were the posttraditionalists who, like the celebrated Egyptian visionary architect Hassan Fathy (1900–1989) before them, looked for inspiration in vernacular architecture (Figure 3).37 There were also the free, and often arbitrary, mélanges of diverse historical forms and patterns from a wide range of Islamic styles, which borrowed from postmodern architecture its idioms and validation (Figure 4).38 This trend culminated in grand structures by large international firms, which reinterpreted visual symbols and historical motifs and used them mostly as surface articulation or footprint patterns in otherwise ultrasleek, contemporary designs.39 A small publishing industry thrived on the growing demand for easily accessible, nonscholarly primers on Islamic architecture, producing numerous books on Islamic typologies, patterns, and monumental landmarks, several of which were reissues of famous nineteenth-century European graphic compendia.40The second phenomenon to propel the new interest in Islamic architecture was the forceful entry of new, mostly Arab Islamic wealth into the international scene following the sharp rise in oil prices in the mid-1970s. Premier Western cultural institutions, already experienced in cultivating patronage, managed to become the privileged recipients of generous sponsorship from wealthy Muslim rulers and business tycoons, who were becoming increasingly eager to counter the Western heritage of negativity toward Islam by presenting a civilized and artistically sophisticated image of Islamic cultures in academia, museums, and media. As a consequence, Islamic art collections were expanded and housed in newly designed sections in top Western museums, even as new museums for Islamic art opened in the Islamic world.41 New academic chairs for the study of Islamic art and architecture were endowed in the 1980s and 1990s at several top-tier American and European universities, almost quadrupling the number of positions devoted to the field. And although this drive started slightly before Said's Orientalism was published, the ideas and language that his book conveyed soon permeated not only the narratives developed around the revived interest in Islamic art and architecture but also the critical stance that a new generation of postcolonial scholars took against the perceived opportunism, naïveté, and even hypocrisy of that same drive.The first effort to package Islam as a rich culture and artistic/architectural tradition was the World of Islam Festival, an unprecedented megacultural event whose origins date to 1973. This event aimed to do no less than “present one civilization—in all its depth and variety—to another.”42 A trust that gathered governments and leading British and international educational and cultural institutions sponsored the festival, which opened in 1976 and included exhibitions, lectures, symposia, books, films, and musical and theatrical performances. One of the exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery in London creatively displayed the “architecture of Islam” by projecting images of hundreds of buildings and their details in a specially constructed cube-shaped theater. This architecture was further explored in several festival-related publications produced over the next decade that covered subjects ranging from the “Islamic city” to the minutest details of architectural decoration.43 Mixing the inherited romanticism of the Orientalist tradition with new and wide-ranging sympathetic scholarship, the World of Islam Festival's publications represented a middle ground between the colonial scholarship of curiosity and acquisition, tinged with the sense of superiority of yesteryear, and the veritable revolution in thinking that came after Said's Orientalism, even if that work's influence remained unacknowledged in several cases.A parallel development to the World of Islam Festival was the founding of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1977, followed almost immediately by the establishment of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA) at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978. Operating independently of one another but having similar aspirations, the two programs had a direct impact on the appreciation and study of Islamic architecture. Through an elaborate process of selection, evaluation, and publication of hundreds of nominated projects from around the Islamic world and beyond over the past forty years, the Aga Khan Award has succeeded in turning a relatively neglected domain of practice into an unavoidably acknowledged contributor to the maturity and diversity of contemporary architecture. Coming on the scene both at the tail end of the postmodern moment and at the time of an intensifying turn toward Islamism, the award initially focused on historical continuity, vernacular revival, and critical regionalism.44 Over time, however, its direction has been adjusted to respond to mounting environmental, social, and global challenges to architecture and development. Incorporating various technologically and environmentally driven, adaptive reuse, and conservation concerns within its core historicist and regionalist criteria, the Aga Khan Award has enlarged its purview in a rather conciliatory manner to encompass contemporary design, social housing, community improvement, historic preservation, and landscape design.The Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture, on the other hand, is an academic initiative dedicated to teaching and researching Islamic art and architecture, urbanism, landscape, and conservation. Given the program's mission of promoting and increasing the teaching of Islamic architecture, the decision to locate AKPIA in the architecture departments of two of the most prestigious institutions of architectural education in the world was a novel and intellectually challenging one.45 The program's implicit aim was to bridge the pedagogical gap between the discipline of architecture and Islamic architecture, which was a clear manifestation of the binary structure of architectural knowledge rooted in the legacy of Orientalism.46That Edward Said's Orientalism still figures heavily in the academic offerings at AKPIA and other graduate programs devoted to the study of Islamic art and architecture is not only a manifestation of the book's enduring intellectual relevance and critical rigor. Alas, it is also a sign of the canonical rigidity and cultural complicity of architectural history's dominant discourse, which still treats architectural experiences outside its own traditional geopolitical and historical domain with suspicion or contempt, especially when these other experiences are motivated by a sense of resistance to that same discourse and its exclusivity.47 For their part, Islamic architectural scholars of the last two generations have rejected the notions of uniformity, introversion, and cultural and religious determinism that long dominated their field and have extended their domain of inquiry into hitherto neglected periods, areas, and points of contact with other cultures.48 The cumulative effect of these inquiries has been to set Islamic architecture well on its way to finally devising its own historical and methodological contours, which, when academic Orientalism is truly overcome, will undoubtedly enrich the broader field of architectural history and finally bring Islamic architecture into its fold.49},

  abstract = {" De quoi n'a-t-on pas écrit l'histoire ? Il en reste une cependant qui est encore à faire, et qui ne serait pas la moins intéressante. Je parle de l'histoire des histoires " (César Daly, 1849). Si, depuis les années 1970, de nombreux auteurs se sont penchés sur l'historiographie politique, artistique ou scientifique, l'histoire de l'histoire de l'architecture a fait l'objet de peu d'études. Les raisons en sont multiples : l'éparpillement des sources, la crise de l'architecture elle-même, les clivages qui peuvent exister entre architectes et historiens de l'art. Sans doute la " muséalisation " de l'architecture, la définition du patrimoine et la pédagogie, sont aujourd'hui des questions incontournables. Examiner les origines de l'historiographie de l'architecture - qui a connu récemment une émergence remarquable - est une priorité pour nourrir ce débat. La matière est riche. Depuis les publications des antiquaires du XVIIIe siècle, la connaissance des monuments ne cesse de progresser. L'exemple des naturalistes, des grands fondateurs de l'histoire politique et des archéologues suscitent la volonté de concevoir une autre histoire de l'architecture, plus scientifique. En France, les années 1863 à 1914 s'avèrent une véritable période charnière caractérisée par d'innombrables histoires, essais, études globales et partielles, par une évolution continue des moyens de représentation de l'architecture, par la multiplication des établissements d'enseignement et des approches pédagogiques. Parmi les grands acteurs de cette période figurent Viollet-le-Duc, Ramée, Dartein, Baudot, ou Ruprich-Robert. A l'issue de leurs travaux analysés ici méthodiquement dans leur contexte, le visage de l'histoire de l'architecture est entièrement transformé. Elle a trouvé sa propre définition, elle a affiné ses moyens de représentation et dispose désormais d'outils méthodologiques efficaces.},

Jusqu'où ces savoirs guident-ils le projet d'une rationalisation des états affectifs engendrés par l'environnement bâti ? Comment s'ajustent-ils aux débats doctrinaux qui traversent le champ architectural? De César Daly à André Lurçat, cet ouvrage propose d'explorer ces tentatives visant à fonder une science de l'esthétique architecturale. De l'éclectisme stylistique au purisme géométrique, l'hypothèse d'un vocabulaire émotif de l'architecture se décline à partir de modélisations variées des processus de perception, d'associationnisme, des théories de l'empathie ou des conceptions mécanistes. Se construisent autant de méthodes d'analyse formelle, qui tendent à réduire l'architecture à des composantes géométriques. L'ouvrage révèle des continuités inattendues, entre culture beaux-arts et mouvement moderne; il met également en évidence les porosités des théories architecturales aux imaginaires scientifiques de leur temps."--P.

  abstract = {A finales del siglo XX se produjo un cambio en la manera de escribir la historia de la arquitectura. A partir de 1999, aparece un cierto impulso para entender la arquitectura desde un punto de vista global, a la luz de la teoría postcolonial. Sibel Bozdoğan hace la siguiente proposición: escribir una ‘historia entrelazada/entretejida,’ que demuestre que el canon occidental y la producción cultural de las sociedades aparte de Europe y los Estados Unidos no son independientes, ni que ésta última fuera a sustituir a aquella. La bibliografía resultante no ha sabido mostrar las sutiles instancias de intercambios entre culturas y de valores universales compartidos, olvidándose de revisar el concepto de universalismo. Este trabajo de investigación propone una revisión crítica de las historias globales de la arquitectura publicadas entre 1999 y 2014, así como de los debates académicos más recientes para entender qué queda por hacer hoy. Aunque puede ser que ‘global,’ como categoría haya perdido su capacidad crítica para comprender el presente, la historiografía de lo global en arquitectura aún tiene que escribirse.AbstractThe writing of architectural history shifted with the turn of the century. By 1999, there is an urge to understand architecture from a global perspective, under the lens of postcolonial theories. Sibel Bozdoğan set the task: to write an ‘intertwined history,’ which shows that the western canon and the cultural production of societies outside of Europe and North America are not separate and independent, nor is the latter to replace the former. Subsequent literature failed to look into subtle instances of cross-cultural exchanges and universally shared values, thus neglecting to revise the notion of universalism. This paper analyses the resulting literature on global architecture published between 1999 and 2014, and more recent scholarly discussions to understand what remains for historians to do today. Though it may be that ‘global’ has lost its criticality as category to comprehend the present, the historiography of global architecture is yet to be written.},

  abstract = {“History, Theory, and Criticism,” the title of many courses and even departments in academic schools of architecture, attests to the easy way in which these subjects are, however undefined, seen as basic elements of an architectural education. The presumed general humanistic aim of these, often separate courses would no doubt be the introduction of potential architects to history, to ways of thinking inherent to the past and present of their practice, and the interpretation of that practice in the past and present. Such courses have been in existence since the initial division of the subject “architecture” in professional schools—from Jacques-François Blondel’s categorization of the field in the 1750s to the AIA and RIBA protocols of the present. And while theoretical incursions from outside have always had their place in authorizing architectural thought, those of the 1960s and 1970s were especially—and deliberately—unsettling. While now happily incorporated in “theory” courses, the resonance and implications of these theories for contemporary research have yet to be fully assessed. Their historicization is not only inevitable, but also necessary, as they are incorporated in the “toolkit” that Manfredo Tafuri saw as required for critical historical work.},

  abstract = {[EN] Quanzhou in south-eastern China was built in the Sui Dynasty, having more than 1,000 years of history. Its urban development led to the triple walls in a different period of time. Its unique landscape of multiple walls is a one of the Chinese ancient city patterns. However, the massive stone-built city wall pattern like Newcastle also has more than 1000, years of history in western cities .City walls maintain the preeminence as the city’s most powerful fixation line. The expansion of the wall in Quanzhou shows how the time-space changes, while Newcastle' s fringe belt is relatively stable, which forms a different urban form. This article mainly compares the following aspects: (1) The development of Quanzhou fringe belt; (2) Differences of fringe belts between the multiple walls city and the sole wall city; (3) Differences of land use in intramural zone between two cities. This paper analyzes the differences of fringe belts caused by city walls between Quanzhou, (China) and Newcastle, (England), and their influence on the urban form between the East and the West.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest from historians in the built environment, the use of architecture as evidence remains remarkably under-theorized. Where this issue has been discussed, the interpretation of buildings has often been likened to the process of reading, in which architecture can be understood by analogy to language: either as a code capable of use in communicating the architect's intentions or more literally as a spoken or written language in its own right. After a historiographical survey, this essay, by contrast, proposes that the appropriate metaphor is one of translation. More particularly, it draws on the work of Mikhail Bakhtin to suggest that architecture-and the interpretation of architecture-comprises a series of transpositions. As a building is planned, built, inhabited, and interpreted, so its meaning changes. The underlying logic of each medium shapes the way in which its message is created and understood. This suggests that the proper role of the historian is to trace these transpositions. Buildings, then, can be used as a historical source, but only if the historian takes account of the particular problems that they present. In short, architecture should not be studied for its meaning, but for its meanings. As historians we are always translating architecture: not reading its message, but exploring its multiple transpositions.},
