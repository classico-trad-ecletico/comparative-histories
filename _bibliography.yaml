  abstract: >-
    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

    Questo volume si occupa di codificare il metodo per l'esecuzione di
    operazioni di lettura delle strutture edilizie che si sono costituite in
    passato a livello di "coscienza spontanea" in una progressione di grandezze
    scalari che vanno dall'edificio, all'aggregazione di edifici, all'organismo
    urbano, al territorio. L'attenzione ai prodotti architettonici del passato è
    il campo della "tipologia processuale" che è la chiave per l'utilizzazione
    della storia nell'operare come architetti nel mondo contemporaneo.

    This paper outlines the development of the Muratorian school of urban
    morphology and building typology. Starting from Muratori's experience as a
    talented architect, deeply rooted in the Roman interpretation of Italian
    rationalism, the authors describe the growth of Muratori's interest in
    history as a means of recovering a sense of continuity in architectural
    practice. Adopting a theoretical approach grounded in architecture and urban
    design, he started working on a critical framework which could explain the
    creation and transformation of urban form over the centuries. He had many
    followers. The resurgence of interest in Muratori's work in the 1990s is
    described.

    The changes that the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) framework obliged
    the School of Architecture of Malaga, University of Malaga. to make to its
    “History of Architecture” course are discussed in this paper. It was taken
    up as an opportunity to modify the whole course, introducing creative
    teaching and “imaginative activities” to put the students at the centre of
    the learning experience and giving them part control over the course. IT
    technologies such as Pinterest were used to create a friendly visual
    learning environment to offer richer learning experiences and positive
    effects on the students. Time dedicated to the presentation of theoretical
    content in the course was reduced by half and the program was redefined from
    the chronology of the previous program to a reading of the use of the
    classical orders throughout history. This change generated interest,
    curiosity and a greater understanding of the relationships between different
    styles which use the same elements. The implementation of several activities
    such as problem solving exercises, complementary readings and video helped
    to focus the course on a student-centred learning environment, was valued
    positively by the students.

  abstract: >-
    The history of architecture has for long time been rather immune to any sort
    of internal and external criticism, that would question the ideologies of
    those writing it, not least in their more or less explicit commitment to
    design practice. This is the more surprising as not only in history, but in
    particular in the history of art, such a criticism, that considers the
    existence of different theories of history, has been established since long.
    The history of architecture has been written very often by architects or by
    committed architecture historians, excluding many unsuccessful and
    problematic aspects of the profession. On the backdrop of this lack of
    criticism, two architecture (art) historian are discussed here for having
    more or less consciously integrated into their work reflections on how to
    write history and thus exposed their theories as part of their writing: Hans
    Sedlmayr and Manfredo Tafuri. While the two historians could not be more
    different in their content – being Sedlmayr extremely conservative and
    Tafuri a progressive Marxist – the comparison of their writings and
    reflections, shows interesting parallels, not least because of the influence
    of their education as architects (which was incomplete in the case of
    Sedlmayr).

    completing the history of the art from the earliest day to the present time

    such a form that it may either be bound up as a third volume of the

    " The first global history of architecture to give equal attention to
    Western and non-Western structures and built landscapes, Architecture since
    1400 is unprecedented in its range, approach, and insight. From
    Tenochtitlan's Great Pyramid in Mexico City and the Duomo in Florence to
    Levittown's suburban tract housing and the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing,
    its coverage includes the world's most celebrated structures and spaces
    along with many examples of more humble vernacular buildings. Lavishly
    illustrated with more than 300 photographs, plans, and interiors, this book
    presents key moments and innovations in architectural modernity around the
    globe. Deftly integrating architectural and social history, Kathleen
    James-Chakraborty pays particular attention to the motivations of client and
    architect in the design and construction of environments both sacred and
    secular: palaces and places of worship as well as such characteristically
    modern structures as the skyscraper, the department store, and the cinema.
    She also focuses on the role of patrons and addresses to an unparalleled
    degree the impact of women in commissioning, creating, and inhabiting the
    built environment, with Gertrude Jekyll, Lina Bo Bardi, and Zaha Hadid
    taking their place beside Brunelleschi, Sinan, and Le Corbusier. Making
    clear that visionary architecture has never been the exclusive domain of the
    West and recognizing the diversity of those responsible for commissioning,
    designing, and constructing buildings, Architecture since 1400 provides a
    sweeping, cross-cultural history of the built environment over six
    centuries. "--

  abstract: >-
    An outline of the debate on the relationship between history and design that
    started in the 1960s prefaces a discussion about the contribution of history
    courses to the education of architecture students. A milestone of that
    debate was the rejection of the idea that the study of history can aid in
    the development of formal languages. Starting from that understanding of the
    boundary that exists between history and design, the article discusses the
    reasons that render the study of architectural history necessary.

  abstract: >-
    The publication of Aldo Rossi's L'architettura della città in 1966 marked
    the conclusion of several years of research and writing on architecture and
    urbanism. Rossi wrote the book as a treatise for a science of urbanism in an
    attempt to establish the principles and terms for analyzing existing urban
    conditions. His thesis responded to a polemical debate within Italian
    architecture of the early 1960s over the future form of the city brought
    about in part, by unprecedented transformations in the postwar city. In this
    essay, I chronicle the cultural context of the debate over urbanism in Italy
    that motivated Rossi to establish objective principles for a new urban
    theory, distinguishing between "the architecture of the city,'' autonomy,
    and the concept of la nuova dimensione.
