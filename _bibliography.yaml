    This book examines the career and publications of the French architect
    Julien-David Leroy (1724–1803) and his impact on architectural theory and
    pedagogy.  Despite not leaving any built work, Leroy is a major
    international figure of eighteenth-century architectural theory and culture.
    Considering the place that Leroy occupied in various intellectual circles of
    the Enlightenment and Revolutionary period, this book examines the sources
    for his ideas about architectural history and theory and defines his impact
    on subsequent architectural thought. This book will be of key interest to
    graduate students and scholars of Enlightenment-era architectural history.

  abstract: >-
    From the seventeenth century onwards, the systematic discovery of the lands
    to the east of Europe gradually established the Orient as the subject matter
    of representation--of illustrated travel accounts, etchings, engravings,
    paintings and sketches. This needs to be seen as part of a larger historical
    episode which has installed representation as the principal construct of
    knowledge in Western culture. The Orient is thereby objectified into a form
    of discourse, as Edward Said has brilliantly shown us, as well as into a
    stereotypical image for consumption and a stylistic category in
    architecture. Through a critique of Orientalist constructs, this paper
    intends to draw attention to an alternative way of looking at the Orient:
    one that does not turn it into an independent, frozen reality outside the
    self-knowing subject, but instead, enters into its world, engages with it
    and employs representation as a critical/exploratory vehicle rather than an
    affirmative/expository one. It is in this sense that the experiential
    sketches and scribbles of Le Corbusier in his "Journey to the East" offer us
    some insight the implications of which are highly significant and relevant
    for the current architectural culture at large.

    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

    In an effort to expand on the traditional rationalist interpretation of
    Viollet-le-Duc, this article explores his ideas of progress and history.
    Viollet's "reason" is described as a dialectical structure which develops in
    time, unfolding through history. From his description of the origins of
    architecture to his account of the great periods of mankind, Viollet's
    philosophy of history presents an ideology of freedom; and through it he
    attempts to demonstrate humanity's progressive transformation of a nature
    originally hostile to man into a new world in harmony with him. The
    historical dialectic follows three distinct stages: Asian civilization
    (theocraty), Antiquity (aristocraty) and finally Christianity (democraty),
    which is a synthesis of the previous two. Such trinitarian rule is basic to
    the dialectical process itself. It underlies not only Viollet's philosophy
    of history but also his philosophy of nature (theory of crystals). Technique
    is the realm of human activity which, for Viollet, best speaks of man's
    dialectical engagement with the world. Viollet's central notion of style
    defines a technical activity; an object endowed with style must result from
    the struggle between the real (the world of nature and tradition, the given
    facts from which human action starts out) and the ideal (the world of human
    aspirations and progress). Style is an expression of dialectical synthesis.
    It is in his description of the difference between Greek and Gothic
    architecture that Viollet's historical dialectic comes through most clearly.
    Greek architecture, for Viollet, is the first instance of an architecture
    which seeks to free itself from the enslavement to tradition. The static
    nature of Greek structural principles, however, still reflects a fatalistic
    vision of the world. In contrast, Gothic architecture is the birth of a
    radical spirit of invention which seeks to subjugate totally both nature and
    tradition. The principle of equilibrium basic to its structural organization
    is an example of man's cunning play with the forces of nature. It embodies
    the "Christian rule" which leaves to man his free will and the
    responsibility for his own works. Christianity is the last stage in the
    historical dialectic where man becomes "a creature in the image of the
    Creator."

  abstract: >-
    The current academic and popular interest in urban history is accompanied by
    methodological explorations. Paralleling the recent trends in social
    history, architectural historians working on urban topics have broadened the
    subject matter. They now investigate social, economic, political, and
    cultural issues to explain the built forms of cities, thereby relying on
    interdisciplinary research. The focus is often on urban transformations with
    a wide-spread concern to address the issues and problems of today and
    tomorrow through studying history. While the recent methodological search in
    urban history is rich and inspirational, it also bears shortcomings.
    Methodological pluralism can easily lead to a diminution of focus and a
    general ambiguity, obscuring evaluation standards. The approaches surveyed
    here display the widening perspectives, but also point to the importance of
    further theoretical and methodological discussion.

    an all-star team of architectural experts in their fields who emphasize the
    connections, contrasts, and influences of architectural movements throughout

    Architecture programs should include a curriculum on philosophy of
    architecture in the analytic philosophical tradition. I describe such a
    curriculum and distinguish it from both the typical architectural theory
    curriculum and the typical philosophical aesthetics courses. Without such a
    curriculum, students likely lack exposure to the philosophical approach to
    aesthetics that is dominant in American universities.

  abstract: >-
    Architectural history books play a significant role in conveying the
    culture, norms, and values of the architectural discipline to newcomers. In
    recent years, numerous publications have spotlighted the importance of women
    and African Americans as critics, creators, and consumers of the built
    environment. Yet, to what extent is this recent discourse on gender and
    racial issues included in architectural history texts? And how gender or
    racially inclusive are they? Are twenty-first-century architectural
    educators presenting newly uncovered architectural histories from the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries? Building upon prior research, this
    article seeks to address these issues by examining history texts currently
    assigned at fourteen leading architectural schools accredited by the
    National Architectural Accrediting Board. In textbooks with multiple
    editions, we compared relevant information in both earlier and later
    versions. Our analysis of these history texts revealed that contributions of
    women remain only marginally represented in the grand narrative of
    architecture. And for the most part, African Americans are omitted
    altogether. We challenge authors to reassess the next generation of
    architectural history texts and suggest ways to do so.

    Using key texts by Gottfried Semper, Mari Hvattum offers a reinterpretation
    of historicism. Hvattum focuses on Semper's two major concerns: an
    understanding of the ontological significance of art and architecture, and
    the rendering of art and architecture as the objects of scientific
    investigation and prediction.

    The Belgian architectural world of the 19th century has been considered a
    fascinating though little studied crossroads of influences. The same could
    be said of the architectural historiography of Belgium, which only
    established its independence from its powerful neighbours in 1830. Two of
    its canonical architectural historical publications, the Histoire de
    l’architecture en Belgique by A.G.B. Schayes (1808–59) and the Histoire de
    l’influence italienne sur l’architecture dans les Pays-Bas by Auguste Schoy
    (1838–85), represent two different ways of dealing with textual and visual
    material. This emerges from a precise analysis of context, authorial voice,
    use of sources and illustration media and relation to repertories of images
    such as private print collections. Typical of Schayes’s voice are the
    sparsely expressed personal appreciations and the many references to
    archives, literature and in situ observations, as if to prove every
    statement in word or image. Meanwhile, he rarely refers to his authoritative
    position as ‘national archéologue’ (as curator of the first national
    collection of antiquités), nor to his collection of prints and engravings.
    Schoy, on the contrary, does not shy from emitting personal opinions and
    boasting about his precious collection, his broad knowledge of rare
    manuscripts and collections and his in situ explorations of buildings. The
    fact that Schoy’s text did not make it into the accepted references in
    twentieth-century architectural histories in Belgium, whereas Schayes’s did,
    reveals much about how the discipline was formed and which methodological
    selections were made during its formative period.

    I outline the discursive logic of the two principal ways architectural
    theory has been conceived: historiographic critique and interdisciplinary
    historiography. Post-Renaissance theory-making fell into a pattern I call
    historiographic critique, which centered around the humanist imperative to
    link historical knowledge, social criticism, and architectural practice. In
    the 19th century, historiographic critique became increasingly incapable of
    creating viable conceptions of the past and was replaced by
    interdisciplinary historiography. The advantages and disadvantages of
    interdisciplinary historiography can already be seen in the work of Mies van
    der Rohe. He abolished narrow historicism in favor of consciously created
    dependencies between philosophy, history, and architectural theory drawn out
    over various times, cultures, languages, and academic disciplines.
    Unfortunately, the paradoxes inherent in the discursive logic of
    interdisciplinary historiography left it open to manipulations by
    intellectual formalists, in whose hands theory came to be treated as a
    discourse separate from its own historicity

  abstract: >-
    Over the last decades we have witnessed the increased intellectualization of
    architecture. What was first a largely autodidactic interest in Heidegger,
    Bachelard, and Joyce, is now the topic of textbooks, anthologies, seminar
    papers, with the committed student having to be familiar with the likes of
    Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Barthes, Jameson, Gramsci, Derrida, Lacan, and now
    Deleuze. Though the architectural "take" on these philosophers is often
    inconsistent and spurious, the enterprise as a whole has to be understood
    within a system that is now almost a century old. Whether it was Le
    Corbusier's readings of Friedrich Nietzsche or Eric Mendelsohn's of Martin
    Buber, architects often turned to other disciplines, including psychology,
    Gestalt psychology in particular, to help position themselves within the
    intellectual determinants of modernity. The "history of theory" is thus more
    than just a specialized problem of the avant-garde. It is equivalent with
    the history of modernity. And yet, despite the importance of these exchanges
    (and despite theory's increasing self-academizations), it is still difficult
    for us to easily assess and historicize them.

    The essay is an analysis Tafuri's theory on historiography;. it traces his
    methodological sources: the theories, and their mode of reception, that have
    directly influenced his thought. The period examined starts with Theories
    and History of Architecture, first published in 1968 and ends with "The
    Historical 'Project"', the introductory essay of The Sphere and the
    Labyrinth, published in 1980 The first chapter outlines the intertwining of
    the two neo-idealist and Marxist components of Tafuri's thought, combined
    with the early familiarity with the writings of the Nouvelle Critique.
    Subsequently, it identifies the points that, in Theories and History,
    represent Tafuri's original contribution to architectural history: the
    identification of architecture as ideology and the consequent demystifying
    role that the historian must play; consequently, the formulation of the
    specific notions that will serve as the instruments for this task of the
    historian; the identity of history and criticism; the complete separation of
    the design process from the 'reading' process (Le. history writing) of a
    building; the logical consequence of this: the 'futility' of history and
    theory in design; and, finally, the obsoleteness of the mode of criticism
    termed "operative criticism". The second chapter tackles the problem posed
    by the contradictory coexistence, in Tafuri's later writings, of Marxist and
    neo-avant-garde positions. It analyzes in detail what neo-avant-garde ideas
    were, what they implied and what theoretical and methodological purposes
    they served. The analysis centers on the strong impact of Foucault's
    theories on Tafuri, and his equally strong criticism of them. Most
    importantly, however, it outlines the profound impact of Walter Benjamin's
    notion of history, particularly as exposed in "The Theses on the Philosophy
    of History", on Tafuri. In the last chapter, are drawn some partial
    conclusions on the epistemological implications of Tafuri's theory.

  abstract: >-
    In eighteenth-century France, the influential architect and historian
    Julien-David Leroy studied ancient monuments through two different
    methods-what he called the "historical" and the "architectural." These two
    approaches had distinctly different intended audiences, methods, and goals.
    His historical method was a traditional humanistic approach to the ancient
    monuments that studied a building's architecture in relation to its specific
    historic context. His architectural method, consistent with scientific
    practice, considered the relations among numerous similar monuments as a
    means of revealing underlying universal laws. In the eighteenth century,
    history and science both promised enlightenment, but the exact shape of that
    new knowledge and its implications for the present varied tremendously.
    Through a comparative analysis of his two methods, and of their development,
    interaction, and significance, this paper assesses the exact shape of
    Leroy's dualistic thought, and its implications for architectural practice,
    history and theory.

  abstract: >-
    Some anthropologists have suggested prehistoric Old and New world contacts.
    Meggers, Evans, and Estrada are the most recent advocates, and their
    hypothesis of a landfall by Japanese fishermen on the coast of Ecuador seems
    to have been the causa belli of the attack by John Rowe on "doctrinaire
    diffusionism." In a response to Rowe, Jett and Carter (1966) suggest his
    level of absolute proof is the best, but not the only, proof. Rowe's
    absolute proof is best because it can be rigorously and objectively tested.
    But if this level of proof is not met, then the acceptance of such evidence
    becomes an "act of faith." The hypotheses of transoceanic contacts can not
    be evaluated adequately for or against until this level of proof is
    achieved. Until such time, the acceptance of such theories will remain "acts
    of faith."

  abstract: >-
    Part of the fallout from the Modern Movement is our perception of our time,
    ourselves, as somehow set apart from history. Our apparently
    anti-historicist heritage, and the perceived failure of its utopia, has cast
    in doubt our relationship with the past and our ability to produce a
    meaningful present and future. In the realms of criticism and design, there
    seems to be an artificial distinction between "then" and "now," leaving us
    in a distended present. Our concern is the meeting point of history and
    design in the activities of operative criticism. Operative criticism,
    described by Manfredo Tafuri in Theories and History of Architecture,
    assumes a subjective reading of history, distorting the past to re-make it
    for the present. Operative criticism accepts the inevitable fact that the
    present always conditions the perceptions of the past.

  title: The critical historians of art

  abstract: >-
    This paper is concerned with the practical problem of shaping a "History of
    Architecture" in a way that expands the dominant canon while acknowledging
    the complex and difficult realities of articulating difference. Through a
    critical analysis of Spiro Kostof's "A History of Architecture" and an
    exposition of the shortcomings of Kostof's attempts to discuss "alternative"
    histories, this paper investigates how architectural history textbooks could

  abstract: >-
    It is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact of Edward Said's
    Orientalism on the various fields of the humanities in Western academia.1
    Said's wide-ranging, profound, and multidisciplinary critique of the ways in
    which the triumphant culture of our times, the Western one from the
    Enlightenment to the present, has encountered, codified, and represented the
    culture of its most immediate other, the Islamic Orient, opened the door for
    all repressed cultures to question their received representation and to
    deconstruct the discourse that produced it over time.2 This has led to the
    revolution in the humanities that we identify today as postcolonial
    criticism, a revolution that was a long time coming, but Orientalism, and
    the charismatic personality of its author, provided the catalyst around
    which its diverse strands finally coalesced.3Even today, forty years after
    the book's publication, and despite sustained denunciation from detractors
    on the right and left alike, Said's fundamental critique of the political
    and ideological frames of knowledge in general, and knowledge about Islam in
    particular, still reverberates across academia worldwide. Entire domains of
    inquiry into the cultural production of both the colonizing and colonized
    worlds, as well as all marginalized minority groups and their sometimes
    amiable but mostly confrontational interaction, have found their ways into
    curricula and university programs in the West and in the postcolonial
    world.4 They have all benefited from the trail blazed by Said's Orientalism
    and his subsequent elaborations on the intersection between empire (as both
    locus of power and representation) and culture and the role of intellectuals
    in our extremely divided yet thoroughly interconnected world.5 In fact, as
    Anne Wagner, the prominent historian of nineteenth-century art, told me
    thirty years ago, scholars in the humanities cannot avoid the “post-Saidian”
    epistemological milieu in which they have to labor regardless of their
    specific fields of study or their views of Said's criticism.Architectural
    history—and architectural practice to a lesser extent—has felt the impact of
    Said's Orientalism as well, even though Said himself, a relentless literary
    and political critic who was also an accomplished pianist and a classical
    music and opera reviewer, had very little to say about architecture.
    Occasionally, he would mention a particular building in passing as a
    backdrop to his narrative in one of the essays or journalistic reviews that
    he regularly published in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly newspaper. But he
    otherwise never turned his sharp eyes and scathing wit directly to
    architecture, even though he was aware and appreciative of art and
    architectural criticism. He did, however, engage in extended debates over
    theoretical and historiographical issues that pertained to art and
    architecture, as I witnessed in 1985 when a group of graduate students of
    which I was a part organized a conference at MIT on the postmodern condition
    and invited Said and Fredric Jameson, along with several leading art and
    architectural theorists and critics, for two days of exhilarating
    intellectual one-upmanship.Unsurprisingly, the clearest influence that
    Said's Orientalism has had within architectural history is on the so-called
    non-Western subfields (a category that reeks of imperialist superiority),
    especially the study of Islamic architecture and modern architecture outside
    the West.6 But it has also affected the study of global architecture, a
    label and an approach that owe much to the rigorous criticism and expansive
    perspective that Said and other like-minded historians and critics enabled.7
    Before Said, architectural history subscribed too uncritically to the
    canonical view of architecture as a culturally stratified domain, with the
    architecture of the West, from its presumed classical origins to its
    glorious culmination in modern times, constituting the historical core of
    the field, while other architectural traditions, if acknowledged at all,
    were relegated to marginal places in its ordered hierarchy.8 This was best
    exemplified by the famous “Tree of Architecture” of the two Banister
    Fletchers (father and son), which appeared as frontispiece in all seventeen
    editions of their influential book A History of Architecture on the
    Comparative Method for the Student, Craftsman, and Amateur, published
    between 1896 and 1954. This unabashed yet fanciful Eurocentric diagram
    reserved the living trunk and the upper, healthy branches of the tree to an
    uninterrupted succession of Western styles from ancient Greece to modern
    America (dubbed historical styles) and demoted the architecture of all other
    cultures (labeled nonhistorical styles) to dead-end branches functioning
    primarily as stylistic curiosities.9Things slowly began to change in 1985
    with the publication of Spiro Kostof's A History of Architecture, one of the
    earliest works to respond to Said's criticism, albeit indirectly and without
    ever mentioning Orientalism.10 The influence, moreover, is apparent in the
    structure of the book rather than in its narrative or arguments, which
    remained wedded to the center/periphery model of analysis. Kostof not only
    included periods and examples of non-Western architectural traditions, a
    practice going back to James Fergusson and Banister Fletcher, but also, for
    the first time in an English-language architectural survey, presented a
    select few of these in comparative pairings with their chronological
    equivalents in the Western historical sequence. He did this exclusively
    between the two sides of the Mediterranean: the Christian and the Islamic,
    with Cairo and Florence paired together in the late Middle Ages and Istanbul
    and Venice in the Renaissance.11 But as architectural historian Panayiota
    Pyla has noted, Kostof's pairings were neither historically nor culturally
    symmetrical. In both examples, he could not shed his reliance on Western
    architecture as the “yardstick” against which the architecture of the
    Islamic other is measured, nor could he contextualize the Islamic examples
    in their own settings (his favorite phenomenological term) as he so
    impeccably did for the Western ones.12The centrality of Western architecture
    in Kostof's understanding of architectural history was even more pronounced
    in his short sections on those architectural traditions—such as those of
    India, China, and Nepal—that did not interact with the West before the
    colonial period. There, his review differed little from his predecessors’
    except in the important distinction of his using a phenomenological language
    that overtly romanticized and somewhat dehistoricized architecture, as
    opposed to the formalist and stylistic language of his precursors, which was
    used to enforce a hierarchical structure of architectural traditions.13
    Thus, it is possible that Kostof's atypical treatment of Islamic
    architecture as the privileged counterpart to premodern Western architecture
    was not the result of a conscious critical rethinking of architectural
    history's biased formation. It may in fact have been related to his
    familiarity with the Ottoman tradition owing to his having been raised in
    Istanbul. But it also could have been a subconscious reaction to Said's
    pointed criticism of the West's long-held derogatory attitudes toward
    anything Islamic, of which Kostof must have been aware and which had been
    intensifying in the time in which he and Said were writing—as they are again
    today.The methodological corrective in surveying global architecture
    guardedly explored by Kostof went through several stages of inconclusive
    refinement in the subsequent three decades, with new editions and revisions
    of the standard surveys in the field as well as new surveys of what began to
    be named “world architecture.” Thus, for instance, Fletcher's seventeenth
    edition of 1961 had replaced the binary division of historical and
    nonhistorical styles of earlier editions with another dyad that, although
    less overtly offensive, still endowed only Western architecture with
    historical evolution (“Ancient Architecture and Western Succession”) while
    gathering all non-Western traditions under the über-geographical and loaded
    label “East,” regardless of their actual location on the world map vis-à-vis
    Europe.14 The nineteenth edition of 1987 (notice the date), however, finally
    softened the hard-edged dual opposition by breaking the content into seven
    sections, arranged chronologically, mixing geographic pairing (Europe and
    the Mediterranean to the Renaissance, Islam, and early Russia) with
    chronological periodization (colonial and postcolonial periods outside
    Europe, twentieth century) in a clear attempt to transcend the exclusionary
    Western succession of earlier editions and to historicize other hitherto
    neglected traditions.15The twentieth, or centennial, edition of 1996, edited
    by the noted architectural historian and commentator Dan Cruickshank, with
    almost twenty consultant editors and contributors, further revamped the
    structure and tone of the book in ways that hinted at a direct reaction to
    the kind of criticism initiated by Said's Orientalism, although that book
    remained unacknowledged in the bibliography.16 This was most evident in a
    new section of six chapters covering the architecture of Islam from its
    pre-Islamic roots in Hellenistic and Persian architecture through the
    Gunpowder Empires of the Mughals, Safavids, and Ottomans. The last chapter
    in this section, however, strangely reverted to two idiomatic conceptions
    about Islamic architecture: the one resurrecting the quality of
    timelessness, focusing on vernacular architecture; the other imbued with
    fantasy and otherworldliness as it projects Islamic garden traditions
    through the prism of a paradisiacal vision that is supposed to have animated
    all garden design over fourteen centuries in diverse ecologies from the
    desert to the rain forest.17 These two tropes had long been espoused by many
    Orientalist historians as essential components of the canned definition of
    Islamic architecture as both artisanally oriented and spiritually
    motivated.18 The reiteration of these notions in this section ignored the
    many recent critical works on both subjects that challenged their validity
    or representativeness and questioned the motivations of those who insisted
    on using them. It also unveiled the residual stratum in some of the new
    writing in this authoritative book, one unable to disentangle itself from
    the Eurocentric roots of its dichotomous structure and its concomitant
    differential projections of historical versus changeless styles.A break from
    the historical, even chronological, Eurocentrism of the survey mode was
    needed if the field was to become truly global. This kind of approach was
    finally undertaken by Francis Ching, Mark Jarzombek, and Vikramaditya
    Prakash in their A Global History of Architecture (first edition 2006 and
    now in its third edition).19 As the insertion of the refurbished term global
    in the title implies, the book tries to transcend the Western bias of
    earlier world architectural surveys by using an inclusive global
    perspective. This is buttressed by a neutral chronological periodization and
    a vast time span to tell the history of world architecture from as far back
    as archaeological records allow. The authors clearly seek to avoid the
    shortcomings of their predecessors, devising a new approach that treats all
    architectural traditions equally by framing them in a comparative
    chronological structure that depends solely on numerical time frames. And
    notwithstanding the huge imbalance inherent in the quality and quantity of
    architectural data available for the various cultures and time frames
    covered, the authors try hard to treat all places and periods with the same
    level of analysis without constantly referring to a model or a core index in
    the form of Western architectural succession.20Here too, however, we can
    surmise the influence of Said's critique, which may have been due more to
    the authors’ general agreement with the postcolonial understanding of
    historiography than to their conscious reading of his books. They do not
    mention Said or his work, or even the term Orientalism, at all in their
    text, but their dismissal of the usual European cultural frame of reference
    and their total dependence on a chronological one betray a tacit recognition
    of the inevitable pitfalls of any culturally self-centered perspective in
    the study of other cultures. Posthumously, Said's criticism of Eurocentric
    nonchalance has been vindicated, even if only tacitly and without direct
    reference. Leveling the playing field in assessing the architectural
    achievements of all historical cultures, however, seems to have been the
    authors’ goal for A Global History of Architecture, a goal that has been
    reinforced by Jarzombek's pursuit of the deepest, and implicitly most
    common, roots of human acts of building in his Architecture of First
    Societies: A Global Perspective (2013), the sequel to his jointly authored
    global history book.21If Said's influence is at best hidden or implied in
    global architectural surveys published after the intellectual splash that
    Orientalism caused, it is more explicit, sometimes begrudgingly so, in
    recent studies of Islamic architecture.22 Translated into the major Islamic
    languages shortly after its initial publication in English, Said's book
    quickly became a best seller of sorts, providing students of Islamic
    cultural production with the critical lever they had long needed in their
    painful, and often unsuccessful, efforts to be admitted into their specific
    humanities fields as full participants rather than as area studies
    specialists. Historians of Islamic architecture faced the same challenge.23
    Their own domain had been seen at best as a self-contained area of study
    that was religiously and culturally essentialist or environmentally
    deterministic, and at worst as derivative, passé, ornamentalist,
    ahistorical, and lacking in tectonic rationality.24 These dismissive notions
    reflected the enduring influence of two manifestly interdependent scholarly
    traditions: authoritative Eurocentric art and architectural historiography
    on one hand, and on the other, the study of Islam in the West that we came
    to call “Orientalism,” with its various peregrinations in the nineteenth and
    twentieth centuries. Such negative views were not applied only to Islamic
    art and architecture. Until at least the 1970s, the same kind of disdainful
    attitudes framed the scope and methods of the study of all non-Western
    artistic and architectural subdisciplines and assigned them their prescribed
    slots in the chronologically, geographically, and ideologically historical
    and artistic Eurocentric hierarchy.25Said insisted on the discursive
    heritage of representation of all things Islamic, a heritage that was
    enthralled with and in the service of imperialism during the colonial
    period, which ranged variably between the sixteenth and the twentieth
    centuries. Indeed, the first students of Islamic architecture were all
    Europeans who, from as early as the 1820s, traveled to the “Orient” in the
    wake of the first European military interventions in search of adventure,
    employment, and the thrill of fantasy associated with those mysterious
    lands. Like other Orientalists in various fields of inquiry, they became
    engaged in a vast enterprise of collecting, processing, and interpreting
    bits of information on all aspects of history, culture, and society in the
    “Orient.” They visited “Oriental” cities and sites—primarily in Spain,
    western Turkey, the Holy Land, Egypt, and India—where they measured and
    recorded buildings and ruins and illustrated them. They then produced
    impressive catalogues of singular monuments, series of buildings, and
    architectural and ornamental details that introduced to Europe a rich
    Islamic architectural heritage that was previously almost totally
    unknown.26These trailblazers were followed by several generations of
    architects, draftsmen, and archaeologists who expanded the scope of this
    surveying and classification in time and space. The architects and draftsmen
    went after the little-known monuments in hitherto unexplored regions that
    were slowly opening up to Western influence and dominance. They covered
    Anatolia, Persia, India, Morocco, and Arabia, and eventually penetrated the
    faraway reaches of the Islamic world in places such as Central Asia and
    sub-Saharan Africa.27 By the middle of the twentieth century, the terrain
    had been mostly mapped out. With the nagging exception of Southeast Asia,
    most major buildings in the Islamic world had been measured, recorded, and
    classified into types and styles following a rather rigid dynastic
    periodization that is still more or less with us today.Despite their erudite
    and prodigious output, these Western students of Islamic architecture were
    neither equipped to convey nor interested in communicating the substantial
    intracultural variety and purposeful continuity within Islamic architecture
    or its conscious intercultural interactions, past and present.28 Instead,
    they set the stage for a self-contained architectural discourse, charting
    the history of Islamic architecture as an endogenous and seemingly insular
    tradition that began with the building of the Mosque of the Prophet in
    Medina around 620 CE and inexplicably fizzled out with the dawn of the
    colonial age.29 Their end dates varied between the Taj Mahal in Agra, India
    (1632–48) and the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque) in Istanbul (1609–16)
    (Figures 1 and 2). But these historians never crossed into the nineteenth
    and twentieth centuries. That is, their history avoided confronting the
    problem of Islamic architecture's encounter with modernity and its
    theoretical and historiographic implications.The practice of disciplinary
    cultural demarcation, which depended more on ideological postures than on
    historical facts or scholarly reflections, survived far longer than did its
    biased and compromised source, the bluntly Eurocentric civilizational
    stratification of the triumphant colonial age.30 It promoted, and even
    demanded, comprehensive studies of architecture confined within clearly
    proscribed and exclusive time, space, and culture. It even affected the
    writing of many postindependence architectural historians in the sometimes
    incongruously formed nations of the colonized world. In their zeal to purge
    their emerging national identities from any potentially damning colonial or
    foreign influence, these scholars adopted the culturally separate line of
    development that the model promulgated, so as to reconstruct a “pure” and
    “authentic” cultural and architectural heritage.31 As succinctly noted by
    Frantz Fanon many years ago, and rearticulated by Edward Said in Orientalism
    and his later Culture and Imperialism (1993), the nationalists’ heartfelt
    resistance to a hegemonic intellectual construct did not prevent them from
    falling into the trap of its conceptual and interpretive biases. They ended
    up constructing and categorizing the history of “their” architecture, and of
    “their” culture in general, from an exclusive and ultimately narrowly
    defined national, religious, or cultural perspective.32 The examples of this
    inclination are numerous, but the most glaring and unmistakably affected
    histories can be seen in the various surveys of Central Asian architecture
    written during the Soviet period, which emphasized ethnic particularity over
    cultural identity, and in the studies of Iranian and Turkish architecture
    produced until very recently in Iran and Turkey, which sought in the distant
    past cultural roots that defined each nation independent of its extensive
    Islamic identity.33The study of Islamic architecture underwent a certain
    renaissance in the past few decades, owing in no small measure to the “Said
    effect.” This coincided with and provided intellectual prestige and
    rhetorical ammunition to two instrumental and ultimately interrelated
    phenomena, one architectural and the other, unsurprisingly, financial. The
    first was the onset of the age of postmodernism in architecture in the 1970s
    and 1980s, with its renewed if lighthearted approach to history as
    inspiration and its not-so-masked stress on identity politics as a formally
    expressive architectural tool.34 Both orientations resonated with the
    mounting pressure in the Islamic world for culturally and historically
    inspired architecture, a direction that started to express itself around the
    same time and for reasons that stemmed primarily from disappointment with
    the often half-baked, top-down, and ultimately miscarried modernist
    experiments conducted throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the newly
    independent countries.35 Thus, the 1980s became the decade of readily
    identifiable, Islamicized postmodern architecture that fulfilled a real
    hunger for cultural (and religious, which would eventually supplant the
    cultural with the rise of Islamism) self-expression.36 There were the
    posttraditionalists who, like the celebrated Egyptian visionary architect
    Hassan Fathy (1900–1989) before them, looked for inspiration in vernacular
    architecture (Figure 3).37 There were also the free, and often arbitrary,
    mélanges of diverse historical forms and patterns from a wide range of
    Islamic styles, which borrowed from postmodern architecture its idioms and
    validation (Figure 4).38 This trend culminated in grand structures by large
    international firms, which reinterpreted visual symbols and historical
    motifs and used them mostly as surface articulation or footprint patterns in
    otherwise ultrasleek, contemporary designs.39 A small publishing industry
    thrived on the growing demand for easily accessible, nonscholarly primers on
    Islamic architecture, producing numerous books on Islamic typologies,
    patterns, and monumental landmarks, several of which were reissues of famous
    nineteenth-century European graphic compendia.40The second phenomenon to
    propel the new interest in Islamic architecture was the forceful entry of
    new, mostly Arab Islamic wealth into the international scene following the
    sharp rise in oil prices in the mid-1970s. Premier Western cultural
    institutions, already experienced in cultivating patronage, managed to
    become the privileged recipients of generous sponsorship from wealthy Muslim
    rulers and business tycoons, who were becoming increasingly eager to counter
    the Western heritage of negativity toward Islam by presenting a civilized
    and artistically sophisticated image of Islamic cultures in academia,
    museums, and media. As a consequence, Islamic art collections were expanded
    and housed in newly designed sections in top Western museums, even as new
    museums for Islamic art opened in the Islamic world.41 New academic chairs
    for the study of Islamic art and architecture were endowed in the 1980s and
    1990s at several top-tier American and European universities, almost
    quadrupling the number of positions devoted to the field. And although this
    drive started slightly before Said's Orientalism was published, the ideas
    and language that his book conveyed soon permeated not only the narratives
    developed around the revived interest in Islamic art and architecture but
    also the critical stance that a new generation of postcolonial scholars took
    against the perceived opportunism, naïveté, and even hypocrisy of that same
    drive.The first effort to package Islam as a rich culture and
    artistic/architectural tradition was the World of Islam Festival, an
    unprecedented megacultural event whose origins date to 1973. This event
    aimed to do no less than “present one civilization—in all its depth and
    variety—to another.”42 A trust that gathered governments and leading British
    and international educational and cultural institutions sponsored the
    festival, which opened in 1976 and included exhibitions, lectures, symposia,
    books, films, and musical and theatrical performances. One of the
    exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery in London creatively displayed the
    “architecture of Islam” by projecting images of hundreds of buildings and
    their details in a specially constructed cube-shaped theater. This
    architecture was further explored in several festival-related publications
    produced over the next decade that covered subjects ranging from the
    “Islamic city” to the minutest details of architectural decoration.43 Mixing
    the inherited romanticism of the Orientalist tradition with new and
    wide-ranging sympathetic scholarship, the World of Islam Festival's
    publications represented a middle ground between the colonial scholarship of
    curiosity and acquisition, tinged with the sense of superiority of
    yesteryear, and the veritable revolution in thinking that came after Said's
    Orientalism, even if that work's influence remained unacknowledged in
    several cases.A parallel development to the World of Islam Festival was the
    founding of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1977, followed almost
    immediately by the establishment of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic
    Architecture (AKPIA) at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology in 1978. Operating independently of one another but having
    similar aspirations, the two programs had a direct impact on the
    appreciation and study of Islamic architecture. Through an elaborate process
    of selection, evaluation, and publication of hundreds of nominated projects
    from around the Islamic world and beyond over the past forty years, the Aga
    Khan Award has succeeded in turning a relatively neglected domain of
    practice into an unavoidably acknowledged contributor to the maturity and
    diversity of contemporary architecture. Coming on the scene both at the tail
    end of the postmodern moment and at the time of an intensifying turn toward
    Islamism, the award initially focused on historical continuity, vernacular
    revival, and critical regionalism.44 Over time, however, its direction has
    been adjusted to respond to mounting environmental, social, and global
    challenges to architecture and development. Incorporating various
    technologically and environmentally driven, adaptive reuse, and conservation
    concerns within its core historicist and regionalist criteria, the Aga Khan
    Award has enlarged its purview in a rather conciliatory manner to encompass
    contemporary design, social housing, community improvement, historic
    preservation, and landscape design.The Aga Khan Program for Islamic
    Architecture, on the other hand, is an academic initiative dedicated to
    teaching and researching Islamic art and architecture, urbanism, landscape,
    and conservation. Given the program's mission of promoting and increasing
    the teaching of Islamic architecture, the decision to locate AKPIA in the
    architecture departments of two of the most prestigious institutions of
    architectural education in the world was a novel and intellectually
    challenging one.45 The program's implicit aim was to bridge the pedagogical
    gap between the discipline of architecture and Islamic architecture, which
    was a clear manifestation of the binary structure of architectural knowledge
    rooted in the legacy of Orientalism.46That Edward Said's Orientalism still
    figures heavily in the academic offerings at AKPIA and other graduate
    programs devoted to the study of Islamic art and architecture is not only a
    manifestation of the book's enduring intellectual relevance and critical
    rigor. Alas, it is also a sign of the canonical rigidity and cultural
    complicity of architectural history's dominant discourse, which still treats
    architectural experiences outside its own traditional geopolitical and
    historical domain with suspicion or contempt, especially when these other
    experiences are motivated by a sense of resistance to that same discourse
    and its exclusivity.47 For their part, Islamic architectural scholars of the
    last two generations have rejected the notions of uniformity, introversion,
    and cultural and religious determinism that long dominated their field and
    have extended their domain of inquiry into hitherto neglected periods,
    areas, and points of contact with other cultures.48 The cumulative effect of
    these inquiries has been to set Islamic architecture well on its way to
    finally devising its own historical and methodological contours, which, when
    academic Orientalism is truly overcome, will undoubtedly enrich the broader
    field of architectural history and finally bring Islamic architecture into
    its fold.49

  abstract: >-
    Doctrinaire diffusionism is a menace to the development of sound
    archaeological theory based on comparative studies; it distracts
    archaeologists from such studies and seeks to destroy the basis of
    comparison. Diffusionist arguments are defective in principle, however. The
    bias in the selection of data for these arguments can be illustrated by
    listing cultural similarities between ancient Peru and the ancient
    Mediterranean.

    " De quoi n'a-t-on pas écrit l'histoire ? Il en reste une cependant qui est
    encore à faire, et qui ne serait pas la moins intéressante. Je parle de
    l'histoire des histoires " (César Daly, 1849). Si, depuis les années 1970,
    de nombreux auteurs se sont penchés sur l'historiographie politique,
    artistique ou scientifique, l'histoire de l'histoire de l'architecture a
    fait l'objet de peu d'études. Les raisons en sont multiples :
    l'éparpillement des sources, la crise de l'architecture elle-même, les
    clivages qui peuvent exister entre architectes et historiens de l'art. Sans
    doute la " muséalisation " de l'architecture, la définition du patrimoine et
    la pédagogie, sont aujourd'hui des questions incontournables. Examiner les
    origines de l'historiographie de l'architecture - qui a connu récemment une
    émergence remarquable - est une priorité pour nourrir ce débat. La matière
    est riche. Depuis les publications des antiquaires du XVIIIe siècle, la
    connaissance des monuments ne cesse de progresser. L'exemple des
    naturalistes, des grands fondateurs de l'histoire politique et des
    archéologues suscitent la volonté de concevoir une autre histoire de
    l'architecture, plus scientifique. En France, les années 1863 à 1914
    s'avèrent une véritable période charnière caractérisée par d'innombrables
    histoires, essais, études globales et partielles, par une évolution continue
    des moyens de représentation de l'architecture, par la multiplication des
    établissements d'enseignement et des approches pédagogiques. Parmi les
    grands acteurs de cette période figurent Viollet-le-Duc, Ramée, Dartein,
    Baudot, ou Ruprich-Robert. A l'issue de leurs travaux analysés ici
    méthodiquement dans leur contexte, le visage de l'histoire de l'architecture
    est entièrement transformé. Elle a trouvé sa propre définition, elle a
    affiné ses moyens de représentation et dispose désormais d'outils
    méthodologiques efficaces.

  abstract: >-
    S'il existe, depuis l'Antiquité, de très nombreux écrits sur l'histoire de
    l'art, son enseignement est beaucoup plus récent : la première chaire, en
    France, fut créée à la Sorbonne en 1899. Cet ouvrage montre comment on est
    passé du cours public d'archéologie, à la Bibliothèque nationale à la fin du
    XVIIIe siècle, au cours d'histoire de l'art, dans les facultés des lettres
    des universités de province au début du XXe siècle, en passant par l'Ecole
    des chartes, l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, le Collège de France et l'Ecole du
    Louvre... Genèse d'une discipline et d'une recherche, c'est aussi
    l'évolution des mentalités universitaires que nous suivons ici. Du cabinet à
    l'université, de l'érudition archéologique au diplôme universitaire, cette
    enquête historique montre les enjeux et les conflits qui marquent les débuts
    de cet enseignement spécifique.

  abstract: >-
    "À une époque où l'esthétique française affine son statut de discipline
    scientifique, les architectes convoquent à leur tour un ensemble aux
    frontières mouvantes, articulant physiologie sensorielle, psychologie ou
    sociologie, et perméable à des courants plus ésotériques. Jusqu'où ces
    savoirs guident-ils le projet d'une rationalisation des états affectifs
    engendrés par l'environnement bâti ? Comment s'ajustent-ils aux débats
    doctrinaux qui traversent le champ architectural? De César Daly à André
    Lurçat, cet ouvrage propose d'explorer ces tentatives visant à fonder une
    science de l'esthétique architecturale. De l'éclectisme stylistique au
    purisme géométrique, l'hypothèse d'un vocabulaire émotif de l'architecture
    se décline à partir de modélisations variées des processus de perception,
    d'associationnisme, des théories de l'empathie ou des conceptions

    tendent à réduire l'architecture à des composantes géométriques. L'ouvrage

    A finales del siglo XX se produjo un cambio en la manera de escribir la
    historia de la arquitectura. A partir de 1999, aparece un cierto impulso
    para entender la arquitectura desde un punto de vista global, a la luz de la
    teoría postcolonial. Sibel Bozdoğan hace la siguiente proposición: escribir
    una ‘historia entrelazada/entretejida,’ que demuestre que el canon
    occidental y la producción cultural de las sociedades aparte de Europe y los
    Estados Unidos no son independientes, ni que ésta última fuera a sustituir a
    aquella. La bibliografía resultante no ha sabido mostrar las sutiles
    instancias de intercambios entre culturas y de valores universales
    compartidos, olvidándose de revisar el concepto de universalismo. Este
    trabajo de investigación propone una revisión crítica de las historias
    globales de la arquitectura publicadas entre 1999 y 2014, así como de los
    debates académicos más recientes para entender qué queda por hacer hoy.
    Aunque puede ser que ‘global,’ como categoría haya perdido su capacidad
    crítica para comprender el presente, la historiografía de lo global en
    arquitectura aún tiene que escribirse.AbstractThe writing of architectural
    history shifted with the turn of the century. By 1999, there is an urge to
    understand architecture from a global perspective, under the lens of
    postcolonial theories. Sibel Bozdoğan set the task: to write an ‘intertwined
    history,’ which shows that the western canon and the cultural production of
    societies outside of Europe and North America are not separate and
    independent, nor is the latter to replace the former. Subsequent literature
    failed to look into subtle instances of cross-cultural exchanges and
    universally shared values, thus neglecting to revise the notion of
    universalism. This paper analyses the resulting literature on global
    architecture published between 1999 and 2014, and more recent scholarly
    discussions to understand what remains for historians to do today. Though it
    may be that ‘global’ has lost its criticality as category to comprehend the
    present, the historiography of global architecture is yet to be written.

  abstract: >-
    “History, Theory, and Criticism,” the title of many courses and even
    departments in academic schools of architecture, attests to the easy way in
    which these subjects are, however undefined, seen as basic elements of an
    architectural education. The presumed general humanistic aim of these, often
    separate courses would no doubt be the introduction of potential architects
    to history, to ways of thinking inherent to the past and present of their
    practice, and the interpretation of that practice in the past and present.
    Such courses have been in existence since the initial division of the
    subject “architecture” in professional schools—from Jacques-François
    Blondel’s categorization of the field in the 1750s to the AIA and RIBA
    protocols of the present. And while theoretical incursions from outside have
    always had their place in authorizing architectural thought, those of the
    1960s and 1970s were especially—and deliberately—unsettling. While now
    happily incorporated in “theory” courses, the resonance and implications of
    these theories for contemporary research have yet to be fully assessed.
    Their historicization is not only inevitable, but also necessary, as they
    are incorporated in the “toolkit” that Manfredo Tafuri saw as required for
    critical historical work.

    [EN] Quanzhou in south-eastern China was built in the Sui Dynasty, having
    more than 1,000 years of history. Its urban development led to the triple
    walls in a different period of time. Its unique landscape of multiple walls
    is a one of the Chinese ancient city patterns. However, the massive
    stone-built city wall pattern like Newcastle also has more than 1000, years
    of history in western cities .City walls maintain the preeminence as the
    city’s most powerful fixation line. The expansion of the wall in Quanzhou
    shows how the time-space changes, while Newcastle' s fringe belt is
    relatively stable, which forms a different urban form. This article mainly
    compares the following aspects: (1) The development of Quanzhou fringe belt;
    (2) Differences of fringe belts between the multiple walls city and the sole
    wall city; (3) Differences of land use in intramural zone between two
    cities. This paper analyzes the differences of fringe belts caused by city
    walls between Quanzhou, (China) and Newcastle, (England), and their
    influence on the urban form between the East and the West.

  abstract: >-
    Despite growing interest from historians in the built environment, the use
    of architecture as evidence remains remarkably under-theorized. Where this
    issue has been discussed, the interpretation of buildings has often been
    likened to the process of reading, in which architecture can be understood
    by analogy to language: either as a code capable of use in communicating the
    architect's intentions or more literally as a spoken or written language in
    its own right. After a historiographical survey, this essay, by contrast,
    proposes that the appropriate metaphor is one of translation. More
    particularly, it draws on the work of Mikhail Bakhtin to suggest that
    architecture-and the interpretation of architecture-comprises a series of
    transpositions. As a building is planned, built, inhabited, and interpreted,
    so its meaning changes. The underlying logic of each medium shapes the way
    in which its message is created and understood. This suggests that the
    proper role of the historian is to trace these transpositions. Buildings,
    then, can be used as a historical source, but only if the historian takes
    account of the particular problems that they present. In short, architecture
    should not be studied for its meaning, but for its meanings. As historians
    we are always translating architecture: not reading its message, but
    exploring its multiple transpositions.
