  This chapter contrasts comparative histories of architecture, prevalent
  from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries, to the critical method of
  history that is claimed by recent works. Comparative history arose out
  of the Idealist philosophy of history and combined its deterministic
  narrative with a disciplinary bounding of architecture that followed
  modern assumptions about decision-making in design. Critical history,
  on the other hand, is a materialistic approach that sees the discipline
  as one aspect within broader social forces. Whereas critical history may lay
  claim, nowadays, to being the only proper form of historiography,
  comparative histories were more closely linked to the methods and
  categorizations of the discipline of architecture. Some 21^st^-century
  architectural history textbooks, committed as they were to the
  critical method, nevertheless allowed Idealistic determinism to creep
  into their narrative structure. I argue this creep is not a
  shortcoming of these individual works, but a consequence of the
  contradictions between the non-disciplinary project of critical
  history and its uncertain place in the professional architectural
  education. I further develop on this contradiction by comparing it
  to the broader problem of how the critical history of architecture
  relates to supporting disciplines such as building archaeology, the
  archaeology of architecture, or the scholarship of vernacular
  environments. These fields interact with history by providing source
  material and preliminary interpretations, yet they have an uneasy
  relationship to critical history due to their partial reliance on
  concepts and categories developed in the professional practice of
  architecture. The inability of critical architectural history to come
  to terms with the historical legitimacy of its supporting disciplines
  is akin to its inability to acknowledge the persistence of Idealistic
  assumptions in textbooks that cater to the professional education
  market.

# Introduction #

This chapter contrasts two ways of looking at the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, made famous by Banister Fletcher's eponymous book
[@fletcher:1896history]. More recently, however, criticism has become so
central to our understanding of the "duty" of history
[@tafuri:1968teorie] that we would hardly admit comparative studies as a
form *history* at all. This notwithstanding, the comparative form has a
stronger claim to being *architecture*.

The problem of history in professional architectural education resides,
therefore, in the interplay between two pairs of concepts in tension
with each other: first, the tension between the comparative method as
part of an Idealist view of scholarship and the critical approach as a
development of historical materialism; second, the tension between the
discipline of architecture bearing upon professional education and the
field of history as understood within the frame of the humanistic
universities.

This brings up a long-standing
paradox regarding the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice. This paradox plays out in a few
21^st^-century textbooks that attempted to distance themselves from the
comparative method. Other disciplinary methods, however, are used in the
study of past architecture and establish particular relations to
historical criticism.

Idealism is known for preferring the general concept to the individual
example [@ghirardo:2008review67]. More importantly, however, it is
predicated on the subject's historically determined agency through the
act of construing concepts. Materialism is evidently the brainchild of
this assumption [@kail:2003vous150151, 170]. In practice, materialist
historiography has come to mean criticism emphasizing effective
socio-economic change, rather than conceptual worldviews.

# Comparative History as Architecture #

Comparative histories of architecture were developed in Europe at the
intersection of the Idealist philosophy of history and the modern
discipline of architecture. It is in fact the concurrent development of
art and architectural history, on the one hand, and of the modern
professional education in architecture, on the other, that set the
conditions for the hegemony of the philosophy of history as an
interpretive paradigm in the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries. To understand
why this is so, one must look at the structure of older art and
architectural history books, from Vasari's *Lives of the artists* in the
mid-16^th^ century to Milizia's *Lives of the architects* in the early
18^th^.

The early 18^th^-century Neapolitan professor Giambattista Vico took
issue with the classical system where philosophy and history were two
complementary yet distinct forms of knowledge. Instead,  integrated
history (or rather, the history of modes of understanding) into a
philosophical system [@vico:2011principi]. Vico's

[@momigliano:1990classical]

Conversely, the notion that architecture had a history---in that
philosophical sense---was also being formulated in the 18^th^ century.
[@winckelmann:1764geschichte] [@legrand:1842essai]

Textbooks such as James Fergusson's
*Illustrated Handbook of Architecture* [@fergusson:1855illustrated],
Auguste Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture* [@choisy:1899histoire], or
Banister Fletchers' *History of Architecture on the Comparative Method*
[@fletcher:1905history] portrayed architectural history as a sequence of
characteristic styles [@barberot:1891histoire1, v] determined by the
constraints of the natural and social context.

Comparative
histories went to great lengths to explain the agency of architects,
since it was by means of historical classifications, wrote Baydar
Gülsum, that "the boundary between the inner and outer worlds of architecture
is carefully maintained for the purposes of disciplinary regulation and
control" [@baydar:1998postcolonial, 8]. Although styles were the most
conspicuous of classifications ([@Fig:treearch]), comparative histories insisted on how
architects had balanced a variety of social and material requirements.
Consider the following statements drawn from Fergusson, Fletcher, and
Choisy respectively:

> Another refinement [in Greek columns] was making all the columns slope
> slightly inwards, *so as to give an idea of strength and support to
> the whole.* [@fergusson:1855illustrated1, 269] [[@Fig:fergusson]]

> The main entrance [of the English Gothic church] was frequently by a
> south-western porch, *acting as a screen against the cold winds*...
> [@fletcher:1905history, 299] [[@Fig:fletcher]]

> Most Romanesque barrel vaults have their intrados broken up at regular
> intervals by ribs ... *these ribs were strengthening to brace thin
> vaults.* [@choisy:1899histoire 2:150, my translation] [[@Fig:choisy]]

In each case, a stylistic motif (roman text) is followed by a
rationale for its existence, in the form of an aesthetic, functional, or
structural problem it solved (my italics).
Comparative historians thus likened the unselfconscious traditions of
earlier ages to the predicament of self-conscious decision-making facing
the modern architect. They emphasized the emergence of the discipline of
architecture through the evolution of structural and
decorative devices. In this sense, then, comparative histories of
architecture were not so much *history* as they were *architecture*;
the anachronistic comparison between ancient traditions and modern
design was admitted for its usefulness as a teaching device.

# Critical History and the Global Textbook #

Critical history arose as a denunciation of operative anachronism;
criticism's emphasis on fragments not synthesis made interest in
the disciplinary textbook falter [@hoekstra:2014modernity2]: the last
editions of both Choisy and Fletcher (not including its later
rewrites [@baydar:1998postcolonial, 13]) date from the 1960s.

Still, the humanistic ideal of architecture education in the Americas
and the Iberian peninsula continued to demand some sort of manual, and
new textbooks continued to appear.
In the ever evolving landscape of critical history, a compromise work as
Spiro Kostof's *Settings and Rituals* [@kostof:1985history] could not
claim authoritative status for long.
Panayiota Pyla showed Kostof resorted to
"Renaissance architecture as a yardstick" to assess non-European
building cultures, and showed little interest in those where interaction
with Europe had been limited [@pyla:1999historicizing52, 218--219].

Pyla's doctoral advisor, Mark Jarzombek, would go on to author his own
textbook in collaboration with Vikramāditya Prakāsh and Francis D. K.
Ching, *A Global History of Architecture* [@ching:2007global]. Jarzombek
went on to claim a "global history" of architecture was an explicit
rejection of the "globalized" appropriation of architecture as a diverse
collection of national histories [@jarzombek:2015architecture, 112].
This harked back to Sibel Bozdoğan's discussion of the opposition
between difference and diversity
[@bozdogan:1999architectural, 209]. Postcolonial criticism,
Bozdoğan had written, resists naturalizing cultural differences as an
ethnographic exhibition of diversity [@bozdogan:1999architectural, 210].

Given this genealogy of critical approaches to global history, it is
perhaps disappointing that *A Global History* does just that sort of
naturalizing the juxtaposition of cultural difference.
The book chains discrete examples in
simple chronological order, under chapter headings with numbered years
rather than the conventional culture--epochs of Western art.
*A Global History of Architecture* is a disciplinary textbook geared to
the humanistic ideal prevalent in the professional education of
architects in the Americas.
Although the book's authors shunned stylistic analysis in
general, they fell into the Idealistic pitfall
that linear time is the one legitimate source of meaning for all the
world. *A Global History* reduced so-called "non-Western" societies to
the Western student's grasp of linear history.
The textbook projected backwards the contemporary anxiety about
essentializing non-Western traditions, and in so doing neutralized the
difference between the historicist societies arising in Early Modern
Eurasia and others having different understandings of cultural
transmission through time.
Upon close inspection, even the book's seemingly neutral chapter
headings appear to be aligned with conventional epochs in European art
history.

# Non-disciplinary history in architectural education #

Kathleen James-Chakraborty circumvented the historicist
pitfall in her book *Architecture since 1400* by establishing the study
of cultures that are increasingly aware of their own history as the
"basic premise" of her book [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xvii].
This insight allowed her to explore the full methodological implications
in the core "project" of critical history [@tafuri:1977storico]:
dismantling the link of architectural history to the disciplinary
delimitation of architecture in favor of a non-disciplinary history of
unbounded social processes [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xviii].

When putting forward the non-disciplinary program of critical history,
Tafuri excluded visual analysis, the disciplinary toolkit *par
excellence*. He considered it hopelessly entangled in whichever
ideological system was current. In contrast, the complex web of
relations that made up the productive system of architecture could only
be criticized in non-visual terms of relations of production
[@tafuri:1980sfera, 22]. James-Chakraborty thus
downplayed reliance on images as a gateway for understanding the social
role of buildings: of the Gate of Felicity in Topkapı palace, she said
"it may not seem particularly imposing, but that is because architecture
was never the whole story here"
[@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, 95].

Therefore, whereas *A Global History* packaged a critical project for
easy consumption in architectural education, *Architecture since 1400*
took the less disciplinary path of doing history *through* architecture
more than history *of* architecture. This opened up a web of possible
connections beyond the conventional boundaries of the profession. That
said, some connections are so far-fetched as to seem arbitrary, as in
the comparison of Versailles to coeval site plans:

> If Bess’s gaze out from the long gallery of Hardwick Hall gave her
> command of the surrounding territory, and Shah Abbas viewed the
> proceedings on the Maidan from the Ali Qapu, on how much greater a
> scale could Louis XIV look out over his dominion...
> [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, 163]

If *A Global History* fell into the pitfall of apparent narrative
neutrality, then certainly *Architecture since 1400* fell into that of
discounting its very subject matter. For all the decentering of European
assumptions in James-Chakraborty's book, its final premise sounds
off-key: "rather than merely reflecting culture, architecture
contributes to crafting it" [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xix].
But if the latter manual downplayed the disciplinary aspects of
architecture---visual composition and professional tradition---, how could
it single out an architecture that crafts culture while standing outside
it? The answer, I believe, is that behind its critical method lies a
philosophy of history: namely, modernization and historicism
as legitimation for a transcendental concept of architecture
[@hoekstra:2014modernity2, 2].

# Disciplinary tools in (or around) critical history #

Critical textbooks on architectural history show an incomplete
transition from the study of buildings within the disciplinary framework
of architecture, and towards a non-disciplinary historiographic ideal of
the past. This transition
will be ever incomplete because the textual craft of non-disciplinary,
critical history uses philological evidence produced by
disciplinary fields of architecture [@tafuri:1991introduzione, 7-8].
This philological framework lies to a great extent, nowadays, in building
archaeology. It developed in late 19^th^-century Germany as a critical
alternative to stylistic analysis [@azkarate:2020archaeology, 526].
Nevertheless, it is still a form of disciplinary scholarship
in architecture [@neumann:2002teaching, 374-5] and thus an
outlier with respect to architectural history
[@perotti:2001archeologia, 379].

The scholarship of vernacular architecture, on the other hand, has often been viewed as
operative and, therefore, un-historical [@carter:1991introduction4].
It deals with social themes that continue into the present
[@vellinga:2006engaging, 83] and therefore
often ends up entangled with building practice, both in experimental
settings and as part of social activism [@ozkan:2006traditionalism,
104--106]. However, vernacular architecture studies have a
critical pedigree, that of anthropology in the 1960s and 70s
[@ara:2016imaging21, 174]. Since then, scholars of vernacular
buildings have increasingly claimed historical status for their research
[@carter:1991introduction4]. A sister field of architectural
anthropology, the archaeology of architecture has an even stronger claim
for critical analysis, unrestrained by disciplinary boundaries [A
comprehensive showcase can be found in @kent:2001domestic] but still
leveraging disciplinary tools drawn from architecture: the study of
functional and symbolic programs, spatial hierarchies, climate studies,
and so on [For a systematic review of these and many other
variables, see @steadman:2015archaeology].

The affiliation of vernacular studies to the disciplinary domain of
architecture is not without its own contradictions. Jarzombek denounced
how the operative disciplines, subsumed in the "preservation industry,"
contaminated the scholarship of global premodern or traditional
architecture with anti-global, nationalist ideologies
[@jarzombek:2015architecture, 118] 
pertaining to an Idealistic philosophy of history. Jarzombek thus
echoed Tafuri in holding global history is "not a discipline"
but "an accusation" tasked with exposing "the epistemological regimes...
that lie at the core of the architectural world"
[@jarzombek:2015architecture, 119]. There is no easy way to reconcile
the disciplinary toolkit of vernacular and archaeological scholarship
with the distrust critical history has for it.
The Marxist ideal that this contradiction would be overcome once every
disciplinary specialization is diluted into "abstract... technical
labor" [@tafuri:1980sfera, 28] shows no sign of coming to pass.

# Conclusion #

Despite the ever-widening reach of criticism, then, Idealist philosophies
of history keep creeping into architectural scholarship. This may stem
from critical history deserting certain subjects or rejecting
contamination by operative requirements. In other cases, however,
Idealism shows in unstated assumptions or expedients in works that
otherwise adopt a critical method. We have thus seen
how *A Global History of Architecture* and *Architecture since 1400* had
mixed results in dismantling disciplinary narratives.
Even as these two books explicitly reject the Eurocentric *argument* for
an evolutionist history, their approaches to collecting buildings and
societies uphold the Eurocentric *structure* of a universal architecture
determined by the Idealistic framework of change through linear time.

The latest editions of Banister Fletcher's textbook, in contrast, have
attempted to break free from this structure by shunning the narrative
unity provided by coherent authorship in favor of isolated chapters
written by specialists. This is unusual in the textbook genre and found
more often in *Companions* [@mallgrave:2017companions], although the
SmartHistory project *Reframing Art History* is another, promising
example of this approach [@reframing:2022].
However, critical history of architecture today functions
in a broad landscape where it interacts with other, more or less
disciplinary fields. The points of contact between these disciplines
and history expose conflicts between the philological toolkit drawn from
the professional field of architecture and history's critical project of
steering away from disciplinary boundaries and unitary narratives.

Much of the disciplinary knowledge about buildings of the past does not,
indeed, make the cut of critical history. This knowledge, however,
continues to provide source material for writing histories of
architecture that pride themselves on a critical perspective. The
contradiction between both domains may well be inescapable.
Even so, architectural history has yet to come to terms with the
legitimacy of disciplinary knowledge of the architectural past. Failure
to do so has led not only to an uneasy coexistence between history and
its supporting fields, but even to the continued creeping of Idealist
assumptions into historical narratives.
